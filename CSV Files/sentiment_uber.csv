0,Absolutely terrible experience ordering dinner for the family Placed an order for pizza  wings  the Uber App said that driver (name not disclosed) would pick up  deliver it It gave me the update that they were waiting for it Then 40 minutes later when they should have taken it the app says a new driver is responsible for my meal order for I called the guy  he said that the other guy had already picked up the order No delivery 10 min later I get left in the dust  no recourse,1
1,Unreliable Drivers cancel constantly and half the time theyre 20 minutes away despite the supposed 3 minutes away For the prices you pay youd think theyd be better Been late to work due to last minute (literally) cancelations Today a driver canceled the trip when she arrived AT my house How does that make sense Shouldve been on time Now Im in a new uber texting my manager an explanation as to how in the world I left the house early to still arrive late Thanks Uber,1
2,Not woth it The price keeps rising The trip prices are inconsistent A trip that would usually cost me $20 just rose to $72 out of nowhere This isnt the first time its happened Fix this issue 12/12/21 Now it just sticks with the higher price no matter how long I wait 12/20/21 Now they drastically increased the uber rewards cost Now I have pay more points to get a discount The price of rides also increased permanently 2/23/22 price for a $20 trip is now $25 no matter the wait or reward,1
3,This app is absolutely ATROCIOUS The amount of headaches Ive gained and money Ive lost in just a couple of months while trying to buy a car is stunning They claim you can cancel your ride but they do a good job hiding the feature in hopes that you wont figure it out in time and they can take your money Everything about the app is so counter intuitive Its as if their primary goal is frustrating their customers I am so pissed that I have given these people money I hope they go bankrupt,1
4,This is an extremely expensive service app with freeapplevel customer service I actually dont mind the fees but the service is completely unacceptable for the rates charged for things like service It doesnt cost $5 to run a computer system for customer service on every order Like I said Ill pay your fees but I will not accept a total lack of customer service with a premium app,1
5,Wouldnt recommend it to anyone unless they are REALLY desperate This is because: 1 The navigator takes the drivers to the back of the destinations which are sometimes very dangerous alleys 2 If I direct the driver to the correct street the app wont allow them to log their trip to complete it 3 It never takes me straight home but asks the driver to drive by only to make them make a uturn back to the spot they drove by 4 A none smoking driver option should be added for health reaso,2
6,Seriously uber has became unreliable So unreliable I bought my own car Literally ridiculous now No one should be 50 minutes late when they schedule a half hour before arriving Half the drivers dont even move from their spot and wont message back Some drive to OTHER locations Some cancel Halfway there I mean really lets get it together PLEASE,1
7,Find another alternative to UBER Their service is horrible and totally dependent on a very limited app to try to resolve any issues Impossible to actually connect with a representative from the company Have been over charged and incorrectly charged for cancellation fees when the cancellation was not my fault Instead of refunding the incorrect charge it is still there even though the app says it was refunded Its always a gamble as to what type of driver you will get Some have been nice professional Many have been totally rude Uber also does very little to insure rider safety regarding CDC and county practices regarding COVID,1
8,This has been a problem way more than once now in the morning is schedule my uber for 7:40 My drivers have been early multiple times and Im not talking like u know 3 or even 5 minutes early its like 1520 minutes early And then Im rushing around the house to finish getting ready I cant make them wait either because uber can charge me for having them wait So I tried scheduling it maybe 7:45 7:50 ish but when i do that the drivers get there late and I get to work late,1
9,Works well enough but for those of us who pay an extra $16 to reserve a ride (a ridiculous amount when what were actually doing is guaranteeing a driver a fare) it would sure be nice to have a notification that a driver had accepted the ride and have that notification show up when we look at our upcoming trips Imagine waiting at 5am hoping but not knowing if someone is actually going to pick you up for your trip to the airport,3
10,Paid for priority and the food delivery was still very late It would have been more effective of my time if I went with my own car In addition the user rating system is broken because if I dont like the service/driver and choose not to tip the driver or person delivering can give you a lower rating,2
11,Its great when they arent jacking the prices up The thing is I shouldnt be paying 10 dollars to get to work and 20 dollars to get home or vice versa I grasp that there areemberships etc but really there is that much of a difference Meanwhile Lyft has my fare for the standard 10 dollars and its not inconsistent and a pain in the neck to get a ride to work Ridiculous Ive been using Uber for a year now and its slowly gone downhill Deleting this garbage app,1
12,For my last couple trips I scheduled my ride ahead of time The app chooses the correct pickup spot while scheduling the ride but the next day when my ride is confirmed and the driver is on their way the pickup spot is changed by the app I dont know why this keeps happening but its annoying Please fix it,3
13,If I could give this zero Stars I would 10 out of 10 DO NOT recommend I tried scheduling for a ride and had to give my payment information they charged me $63 and some cents for a ride to the airport however I never received a ride Tried scheduling it and was given notification that there was no rides available in my area However Uber still charged my account for the ride Theres no way to contact customer service to resolve the issue Uber just stole my money,1
14,App is impossible to sign in or sign up Will not retrieve or recognize my phone number email address or answer questions No live help available only automated runaround Over an hour spent trying to get into the system to order a ride No progress Switched to Lyft,1
15,Wow this app is a MASSIVE drain on my Galaxy s9 battery My 2nd ever time using Uber wasnt good Im not sure who was at fault but I requested one outside the casino and it kept saying the driver was 4 minutes awayfor 30 minutes We were out in the cold at night and you could see them just sitting there Not sure if it was the app or driver but I was so worried my phone went from 47% to 15% while waiting Luckily I could send a message to let her know my phone was dying,1
16,Unable to add or update my card information I know everything I put in is correct and I was unable to find a number for customer support on the issue The website was not helpful and the options did not apply to me either I tired Uninstalling the app multiple times and clearing cache/data as well with no luck Abandoning for a competitor after this Logged in to Lyft on the first try sorry but definitely lost me as a customer after this,1
17,Maybe I can reach customer service this way since I got hung up on twice I linked my Bonvoy Account to Uber where Im suppose to get points for uber rides and uber eats Apparently they want to give you points when they want to give you points I have had multiple transactions with uber and uber eats from the 12th16th of Feb I have only 1 transaction with points on the 14th This partnership could be good if Uber actually submitted the information to Marriott Bonvoy,1
18,horrible first experience I requested a ride 5 hours in advance and wasnt notified until after opening the app after the scheduled time that drivers werent available at the time my ask for email and phone number if youre not going to contact anyone Id much rather pay local cab fairs,1
19,Here I am trying to get home safely after a few drinks for a work gathering and the app has more errors than a Bethesda game Great way to keep people safe and healthy when someone cant even order a ride Edit: this problem has begun happening more often An unhelpful error message of oops try again later doesnt help when someone is stranded somewhere like a bar or airport trying to get home safely,1
20,This app sucks This app does not provide an issue typein so I can type in a specific issue I work nights sometimes its hard getting Uber to where I live Where you typein your location It said enter drop off spot I thought all I have to do is press which location of my drop off spot and the Uber will take me to my workplace But it turns out that instead of sending an Uber to my pick up spot the pick up is my work place and drop off is where I want to be pick up Devs fixe this now,1
21,The only upside to this app are nice drivers and it motivates you to BUY YOUR OWN CAR App is terrible and unreliable constantly gets the pick up address wrong a destination 10 minutes away by car takes DANG near an hour just to get to because of lack of drivers long wait times drivers cancelling and completing other trips on their way to your destination and being rerouted constantly AND its costly Dont trust those fare estimates Use cab dispatchers or public transport if you can,1
22,Zero star app Works great for a bit Then it forgets your password when I try to reset password to my usual I get told I cant reset to a password I already used So it knows my password is correct it just wont let me use it It will not send verification codes to my phone so I cant do that and to top it off i cant even order with postmates because Uber bought them and bricked that website as well Uber is a scam and Im using lyft and doordash put of spite of this garbage service,1
23,Drivers constantly cancel on you leaving you to be late for whatever youre doing and you still get charged Drivers dont know how to read maps or navigate streets dispite being their professional source of income Drivers make up more expensive route to get paid more (dont get caught up in conversations they will distract you),1
24,Customer service was not the best to say the least All I needed was to delete a card from my wallet and I couldnt do it from the app or from my laptop and was given a sorry something went wrong message When I asked for help through the chat No one could find a way to just delete the card and be done with it,1
25,This service is so stupid I have to go 16 minutes because the USPS cant deliver a package apparently and the package is a part for my car I needed a ride from uber to and from the post office to get my car running This service tried charging me 4279 one way Wouldve been over 80 bucks for a half hour Absolute trash,1
26,They spam your email with promo codes that dont work when you actually go to use them in the app Reached out to customer service and they just copy and pasted their FAQ which was entirely unhelpful Seems like blatant false advertising to me so Ill be using the competitor from now on,1
27,The problem with Uber is if youre even a little bit inconvenient for a driver they will cancel your trip and youll have to find another one By the time three drivers cancel on you youll have been waiting for 30 minutes or more Im tired of not being able to count on Uber,2
28,I wasnt able to tip my drivers and figured there must be an update I need to do Did the update and now I cant book a trip AT ALL they give me no option to put in my pick up/drop off location Doesnt matter if I press the back up down profile etc buttons I CANNOT BOOK A TRIP I just see the map of the damn world,1
29,Used it only 3 times twice for rides and once for Uber eats My Uber eats never arrived but I was charged was not contacted by the driver or the app about the delivery or any complications The same thing happened on my first ride however for that I tried contacting the driver and got no response,1
30,When it comes to adding a tip viewing the receipt and the actual charge Ubers app lacks transparency Be careful not to turn a 20% tip into a 40% tip Once a user tells Uber to add a tip the receipt should update and the add a tip link should disappear The driver was great the app is not,2
31,My app constantly loads incorrectly with missing buttons and options I have tried both WiFi and mobile data neither load correctly after updating and uninstalling and reinstalling over and over again Extremely frustrating experience when counting on this app for transportation,1
32,There really needs to be a help option for when you order an uber and the driver never leaves their location to pick you up and just wait for you to cancel My favorite is when theyre 5 mins away then 8 mins then 12 mins and they just keep going and dont respond to messages,1
33,normally apps notify you when your drivers outside this app does not in fact the app will just cancel the ride if youre not outside in the time frame that is said they will be outside the timeframe that they dont give you because they dont give notifications instead of giving you a full refund they give you back your Uber cash that you wouldnt even need if it did its job the correct way in the first place I want a refund not your uber cash bandaid of a fix,1
34,This is the first time Ive ever used your service After 10 minutes of updating and trying to figure out what you needed me to do I finally have a ride on the way It seems booking the ride is much more important than all the other things that could have been done while I was in the vehicle and on my way It doubled the time that I had to wait for my ride Thank you,5
35,It just doesnt work Tried updating deleting and reinstalling and it still doesnt work I can enter the pickup location but cannot put in the drop off location My profile doesnt show up but my phone number is recognized Please help to fix this,1
36,Wow Just wow Tried 3 times tonight to get a ride home from the airport (cant schedule ahead) no drivers available and it tripped the fraud detection on my bank account because Uber charged me three times (and then refunded the charges but still) Will definitely be avoiding Uber,1
37,Bloody horrible I been using Uber since it came to Puerto Rico But I am not in one of the big places Like San Juan or Old San Juan Or in that area So all the ubers from my area leave For one of the big stops and they dont pick us ( people from my area ) up because its not Money good for them Because they only pick people up that will give them $15/20/25 or more up So all of us that dont have cars have no choice but either walk or find a way to get do our destination Horrible,1
38,Requested a ride the night before Shows my driver 5 minutes away I keep watching for a car to pull up It never does Uber just says wait at pickup So I go wait outside in the cold for 15 minutes the ride never cancelled or told me the driver wasnt coming I had to cancel the ride for it to tell me theres no drivers Im late for work now I select a normal ride and its accepted within a minute This app is for drunk people after bars not somebody with a schedule,1
39,Uber has never let me down until I was in Florida There should be an option to choose and English speaking driver or have that automatically as an option in your settings Our driver was not even able to communicate with us enough for us to tell him to take us back home when the place we wanted to go to ended up being closed Please add that option to choose someone who speaks your language,1
40,App on itself is fine wait times are longer than it used to be my main issues is that there are some drivers that would cancel if I am paying with Visa Not only it is a huge waste of time but the delay on payments shouldnt be the users problem,3
41,My driver ended up getting a $13+ tip when it was supposed to be $660 based on 20% There were added fees which shouldnt be in the calculation but even that didnt add up There is no way to change tip after the ride except to add to it No customer email or phone This tip some how doubled Jan 25 2022 : Sent email as per you instructions Now Feb 19 2022 and havent heard back and didnt expect to,1
42,Id like to give 0 stars The driver Barbara said she couldnt find me when I had not moved since requesting pickup I think she drove by me a couple of times Then she said she would have to cancel Only I didnt get a full refund and now the app wont accept my payment info Spoke with my bank the issue is not the card HORRIBLE SERVICE,1
43,They stole my $75 Bought a gift card online the redeem said it was already redeem and that was my first using it right after purchase They made so many excuses to not solve this issue Still not resolve Cant get in contact with a real person Its obvious they sent me an invalid code They will not refund or send a new code They wont investigate to see who use the code and accoun it should only be me it was sent to my email They are crooks for this Uber is known for frauding customers,1
44,They only have customer service if you pay extra there surge pricing is unpredictable and usually triples or quadruple the cost Which is price gouging If you do try to contact them via email prepare to wait a few weeks,2
45,I really have not ever had a complaint about Uber but this is my first time and its the second time this has happened my husband has tried to download his location to go home from my home and when we push it in it says there is no Ubers available in my area and I know thats impossible because I live in Buffalo New York where people take Ubers all the time so you need to fix this Uber I dont know why its saying theres no Ubers available in my area Ive uninstalled and reinstalled,1
46,This app is terrible keep getting an error message that says there was an error processing your request No explanation for how to fix it No support line to help guide me through it Uber is per trash,1
47,No customer support Ive been transferred 9 time and no one can help me It like pulling teeth just for customers to find a lost item in an Uber Put a damn customer support number online Kinda hard to go into the app for support when the phone is the lost item in question,1
48,The app is ridiculous I have plenty of money in my uber cash and it still tries to take from my card On top of not accepting my cashapp card Google pay or PayPal as a payment type when my boyfriend can on his app Or it charges both my uber cash and my card I work early and schedule rides and its unacceptable Cust service is a joke If I could leave no stars I would and I dont usually leave reviews like this but ridiculous is putting it nicely,1
49,Had this app for years All of a sudden I cant request a ride All I get is an error message stating that an error occurred and to contact support Support is helpless at best Uninstalled reinstalled even changed my tel # and my email Still get the error message DO BETTER UBER,1
50,It was great until I upgraded my phone and lost nearly $150 in Uber cash If there is something else available in my area I will be switching immediately as I havent been able to find a way to get that money back through costumer service I cant find a number or an online option and that is absolutely ridiculous The drivers however are amazing So I give them 5 stars,4
51,No direct line to call customer service I moved and changed my address triple checked that all information was correct etc Suddenly cannot use the service I switched to Lyft The app loops you through frustrating lack of customer service options and the notifications are far too often,1
52,I cant believe it If you schedule a ride in advance it says you can cancel for free anytime Only they dont tell you that that there is a $650 cancelation fee built it The price for scheduled it $3250 with all fees vs $1850 normal fare,1
53,I got charged 999 out of nowhere I hadnto download this app to try and find a help line number and there is NO HELP LINE This is ridiculous Why was I charged this when I havent even used the service,1
54,The convenience and quickness of Uber is awesome But the GPS they use is horrible It sends drivers zigzagging through the city on littleused alleyways has them going around in circles and has them going past the destination then backtracking for several blocks Just ridiculous,2
55,Most of the drivers have been great The app tho can be overwhelming with notifications Ya lost your notification permissions Uber This is your doing for reminding me every week even when you havent been started up or needed Seriously the advertising notifications even when not turned on is annoying,3
56,My app does not have the three bars in the left corner Cant access account Also no way to check on a scheduled ride You pay $15 more dollars to schedule a ride and cant confirm it App needs improvement,2
57,Dont bother trying to reserve a ride ahead of time in the suburbs Drivers show up late (as in 30 minutes late) or dont show up at all and there is 0 customer service Call a taxi service instead,1
58,1 Drivers will accept your ride but cancelDrivers 5 minutes away wont accept your ride but drivers 20 + away will (smh) 2When you schedule a ride price increases I dont have a problem withI just hate when they cancel It takes hours before you get another ride 3 This is not a reliable app Better saved to get your own or find another way get around Uber just not it but I had good drivers,1
59,Horrible On multiple occasions I have ordered and ride and it took over 20 minutes and still no confirmation of a ride and had to cancel Prices then trippled for a ride,1
60,Literally spent 200$ on gift cards they told me to uninstall my app and redownload it Now I cant even get to work or use my payment method or anything Had me taking to a box for 3 hours just to log me out I still have to call or we the email they gave me for some location in Jersey And I have screenshots,1
61,Its not working Ill type in the to location and it wont even load on the map or period It doesnt work and has made me waste more time than I shouldve I guess Ill just have to stick to lyft,1
62,This app will steal your money if you book a ride than cancel it because you dont want to wait 30+ minutes for a ride(it will tell you 10 minutes or less before you book it) they still charge for the ride,1
63,Works Sometimes Its saying there is an error with all payment methods as of late it works in us no problem Expensive but no problems But cant relay on it internationally,3
64,Garbage Now I remember why I deleted this app a while ago Got an uber gift card from someone and now I need to use it I have searched high and low in the wallet section of the app and guess what Nowhere does it say redeem a gift card Smh Figured it out For those of you following all the tips/links on google and still failing add the gift card number to the promo code section and make sure theres no space at the end Then wait a few minutes and it will appear GOOD LUCK,1
65,Uber is good but I had one bad experience I called a uber well requested a uber to take me to work and the Uber was like 2 minutes away I guess once when a man realized the type of neighborhood I stayed in he switched and gave me to someone else and they took 17 minutes to take me to work what made me mad was the Uber that didnt pick me up the first one he got paid and he didnt give me a ride someone else came and I had to pay another Uber driver I would like to get my money back,3
66,You cant rely on this app They use shorter pickup time quotes then when you book the ride they increase by 30 minutes If you have to be somewhere at a scheduled time Dont use Uber they will fail you,2
67,This app stops working randomly causing you to having to redownload the app Then after that you still will not be able to book a ride This has happened more then 3times,1
68,Not So good Left phone in cab I could not retrieve it without my phone 4 days I tried I give up on the whole mess Worst of all it my lady friends cell and Ive heard about it every day since Plus I have to shell out for new one THANKS BOOBER,1
69,Ridiculous how much I go through to get transportationI shouldnt have to use $50$100 before I get transportationThen have to wait for Uber to refund the funds they take before a car is even foundWhy not put a hold on the funds vs taking the funds out my accountThe prices go up at least 4x the amount when its coldcertain timesand when drivers are limitedYouve got to do better,1
70,It is 2022 Beyond ridiculous that Uber Android app is still only running in light mode It is stubbornly refusing to go dark even when using dark theme enforcement from apps such as DarQ I refuse to give Uber any business until it can be run in dark mode,1
71,This app is trash  you cant properly get issues resolved Incompetent people who do answer custome inquiries as you to describe your issue a minimum of 3 times It is absolutely horrible dont use the app use in browser if you quickly need a ride Youre own your own if you have an issues with that ride tho,1
72,Prices just keep going up up up Almost $30 just to get to work now Custom drop off spot Thats a penalty fee Redeemed 10% off RATE SPIKE Fake holiday Artificial demand  price hikes Uber is no better than the taxi authority And then drivers decide to up  cancel when theyre close enough Outright bail with no warning App also likes modifying the pickup spot without warning some cities restrict where they can pick up  drop off,1
73,Used to be decent and reliable Now both the company and drivers are greedy The app constantly gives incorrect information/hour long waits drivers no call no show Back to lyft I go,1
74,The service is (probably) fine I dont remember if I used it at all because when I needed to use a ride app I first used Lyft I own a car so unless I have car trouble I generally dont need a ride anywhere That said you never know when you might need to call for a ride THAT brings me to the issue with this app I dont know why your app icon is all black (that would be more fitting if I were calling for a medical examiner or something) but I have a relatively (mostly) black wallpaper on my phone (its a STAR WARS wallpaper) and the last time I DID need a ride I used Lyft because I saw the icon on my phone My phone is not fillled with app icons so I didnt notice I had Uber installed  in fact it is right above the icon for Lyft on my phone You either need to put a lightcolored border around the app icon or change the app icon to a lighter color or give the users a choice of colors to use but all black is no good I like my background on my phone to be dark so I need another color besides black for the app icon Im sure Im not the only one who has had this problem though no one else may have said anything Sure there are probably other apps with an all black icon but I dont use any others that are like that I even have an app called Pitch Black Wallpaper (which I use from time to time) and the icon for THAT is NOT all black: Its a gray circle with a black rectangle that represents an all black phone screen so IT doesnt get lost (although I dont keep it on my main screens) Anyway please consider the options I mentioned The next time I need to call for a ride I might forget Uber is installed and use Lyft,4
75,The app after the new update keeps stopping and Im unable to go inside the app and login using my number Fix this issue as soon as possible Model : Samsung Galaxy A51,1
76,If there was an option for no stars that would be my choice This company has the worst customer service ever When trying to resolve an issue with being charged for the wrong trip I could never talk to a representative there wasnt anyone there to help me,1
77,Its great for picking up  dropping off after 12pmit knows where I work but says it doesnt exist but Ive had plenty of drivers pick me up where I work  to top it off it fluctuates pricing in the morning from 5am to 7amI dont think Im gonna keep using this app to get rides to work  home,2
78,Horrible app and no customer support My phone number was being used by another party that doesnt have access Doesnt let me delete account either Instantly reactivates it after i delete it,1
79,Ive had nothing but good experiences with Uber and Ive only used it three times already to go to hospital everyone was professional and seems to have gotten there in a decent amount of time considering they come from all over,3
80,Uber has overdrawn my account I was charged $9999 for no reason Good luck talking to someone if you have an issue like this The only help line is for drivers and online theres no support,1
81,Double charging rides as of late then when you report it to uber for a refund they say that you are doing fraud by asking your bank to dispute the charges or blame a system error i got recharged for a refund from november 11th on november 27th for $4104 which was refunded by bank after a claim / dispute Uber is a PoS if i wanted to pay 40 a ride id take a taxi cab yes they are around you stole jobs and income from them,1
82,I drive for Uber and dont have a ton to complain about with the driver app This is my first time using the RIDER app and Im pissed I could not check on the location of my driver before he arrived and I could not send him a message to help him find my house He had a hard time finding the house and when he sent me a message it popped up at the top of my screen but I could not open it in the app to respond What the f Uber,1
83,Not good You must show where from to where and what time to pick up and the costs a d type of vehicle I do not see these simple steps They may be there but I do not see them,1
84,Im wondering what is going on with Uber at this time Whats going on with the app Ive been extremely patient not complain Its just lately Ive been late to work 8 times Uber is my only resource for work Drivers are out will accept the trip and cancel just when a surge happens Uber is pushing riders to leave and try other ride sharing companies Ive been triple charged several times for 1 tripDue to an Uber driver coming to my job disrespecting meI got suspended Losing me as a rider,1
85,For some reason i get stuck on the connecting to driver screen even though there is clearly a car on the map Im sick of being forced to walk during the winter because this app cant get more drivers,3
86,Greedy decision to devalue the point system in the rewards What was 2000 points has been raised to 3500shameful CORRECTION4000 Disgusting I wish I could rate zero stars and write the review,1
87,I have had such a bad experience overall with everything about UBER that l am physically ill I am tired of also trying to get any type of customer service that I am convinced that Uber is a scam operation I have been charged 3 times for the same ride and the ride I had ordered was not for me but a disabled man and his wife and 2100 to go 4 blocks is absurd for 1 thing but when I book it and it says 3 mins unless something happened within 3blocks from where we were located I expect it,1
88,There needs to be a punishment for those who accept a ride and then cancel it on the last minute Ive been late too many times that thiss becoming something that I consider everytime I order an Uber FIX YOUR SYSTEM,1
89,I hav used Uber for a long time Friends have said its not the same in the last year but Im loyal This morning my 4:204:30AM driver called at 4:19 I confirmed I was on my way down and he called again as I was navigating the stairs with luggage in hand at 4:24 I saw him drive away as I opened the door to my building 10 seconds later I missed my flight I will never use Uber again And you should not either,1
90,The app doesnt work at all Doesnt give me any info a driver just shows up I have no name no car description no license plate no ETA Its lyft from now on,1
91,Very poor experience Keep declining transactions and wont let you replace card easily This app is complete trash Tryin to control too much and minimalistic features dont help,1
92,Was charger for my ride and was charger a random 35 dollars for no reason Trying to contact support but idk how or why i was even charged the 35 dollars I will be using lyft from now on,4
93,Just watched 2 drivers leave us with no response to either text or call communications and they only offered app credit which is useless A Where we live there are almost no uber drivers (we are out of town) B Why would we use an app that abandoned us twice in one night Also has been very inconsistent in the past,1
94,Drivers will cancel on you that are right around the corner or it will be pending for a driver to accept you but they never will and you cant call another uber unless you cancel and get hit with cancelation fees even with uber one or the price will hike from $7 to $20 out of no where,1
95,No longer reliable Uber is no longer a reliable service The drivers decide when they want to pick you up and reject places they dont want to go This is a good service if you do not really need to get somewhere However if you need to be somewhere its worth getting a traditional cab,2
96,Confuse way for tipping The app give you the option to tip before hand and I choose to do it then At the end the app ask to give the driver the tips I though the tips did not go through the first time so I choose to tip for the same amount again I got nothing to complaint about the driver The ride was good but not that good to receive double tips ,2
97,Unacceptable Whenever I order food through Uber I never NEVER get an alert What a trash app Every other food delivery service gives alerts,1
98,Finally us drivers can see the Fare pick up and location a trip is going Please keep it this way I like that I can control not to go a direction I dont want to go bc it takes me way out of my area Thanks for changing it,4
99,Unreliable I schedule rides the drivers cancelwait times are 20 minutes plusI usually end up requesting a Lyft instead their always close by and the Lyft drivers are more professional,1
100,Useful but only When the app decides to work it almost never lets me schedule a ride or get a ride on demand regardless if theres a driver near by or not,3
101,Cant call any rides because the app keeps saying oops something went wrong and uninstalling/installing the app didnt change anything Time to use Lyft,1
102,Generally speaking its been useless for the past few months to schedule a ride in advance Youd think thered be greater priority put on those who specify a time well in advance of needing the ride but I regularly am projected to be waiting 20+ minutes past my scheduled time for a ride I have been trying Lyft as an alternative in those cases and they have arrived faster on the spot than my prescheduled ride literally every time,2
103,Why doesnt the choose your ride screen show up anymore And I have updated the app and still no pop up screen Please fix this,1
104,I didnt understand the wait fee when Im standing outside waiting 3mins The price on the app says one thing but at the end of the ride is so much more,2
105,Ill chance my rate once Uber has a customer service phone number where we can reach a real live person that we can talk to about problems were having with the app or our drivers or just Id we need help with anything My girlfriend left her phone in there Uber so i tried getting ahold of Uber customer service phone number so i can take to a live agent But i didnt know they didnt have oneso now my girlfriend is left without her phone and she needs her phonecause of Gmail pwfbect,1
106,The app is not letting me set up a payment method It keeps telling me error when I try to connect to Google pay and when I try to put in my card information it said my information is wrong but I have all my information in front of me the app isnt working,1
107,From last 2 weeks the screen is showing only world map nothing else no booking screen no trips,1
108,Uber lies to get rides I was told a ride was 2 minutes away In fact it took 15 minutes because the car was goin 7 miles further away from me Its fraud to make me use Uber instead of another service and caused me to be late And there is no way to punish uber without punishing the innicent driver,1
109,I have had an Uber account for over a year and recently its been been telling me that it got my location wrong because I dont have a location set up right Piddleposh You turn on location for Uber and theoretically thats how it works Not sure what had been going on it was working fine for a long time,2
110,Really easy and convenient I always get an Uber quickly and they are always so nice and always on time if not early,5
111,This app will not let me finish signing in I had the app 2 Mos Ago and it worked fine now I can not logincant use or chg password Im lost,1
112,Rude drivers Adding: whats the point of scheduling something in advance I scheduled my fiancé ride 10 hours prior so I wouldnt miss work He was going on to get surgery Uber never shows up they dont give you heads up or notify you that they arent coming he ends up missing his appointment now we have to pay a $800 rescheduling fee and on top of that I still had to mis work to fix this Uber compensates me $3  what an insult,1
113,Wrong location vs what was booked Took me 25 min in worng direction Nothing close to address entered in their sytem,1
114,Very easy to accidentally type in the wrong address when ordering food Not good when ordering from abroad,1
115,Customers should be notified if the credit card has expred Also it should be clear how the credit card can be updated,3
116,I have been charged more than the price I was shown prior to accepting the ride on my last two rides No traffic or any reason to believe the overcharge is legit F this company,1
117,If youre getting picked up find the address youre at and punch it in manually If you let it direct the driver to you its prone to giving the wrong address and they hit you with a Cancelation  fee when the driver just takes off and you have to call another Absolutely DO NOT trust the app to properly provide your location Other than that Ive had no real issues but its a pretty major one,2
118,If the fare is estimated under $10 it takes forever for drivers to accept Ive been late to work so many times because of this My start time is at 6 I start ordering at 4:45 there are drivers nearby but they dont accept And when they do theyre more than 25mins away Very inconvenient and frustrating Its been like this for months now Lost a job over it Very poor service,1
119,The price changes are very dramatic and seemingly random depending on the day One day a ride will cost me 14 bucks and the next that same exact ride will be double or even triple the prince There is also no other or type your own answer option when giving less than a 5 star review and not all issues that may occur are one of the options to select from Overall just a poor customer service experience and a lack of understanding on how to properly run a service like this,2
120,Trying to get help for something with this app is ridiculous they tell you to send an email and when you do it says its unmonitored and that you have to use the app or site but when you go in they dont have an OTHER REASON choice where you can just send a message because none of their options pertain to your issue Im getting tired of this company too many problems with barely any solutions taking place,1
121,Im sorry but not being able to edit your tips is the dumbest thing I get it but what if you tip too much You have to go through your bank to reverse the charge and just not use the app to tip anymore,1
122,Seriously Im drunk off myass and Im trying to get an Uber App sucks Im putting in my new expiration date for my existing card and the app logic doesnt let me Delete the old Car it just adds a new card ND never results in using the new card Its 20 degrees out here Fix your damn app Luckily Im not too drunk to freeze to death Im taking a lyft,1
123,Uber is quick and convenient and has a lot of options I love Uber for what it is a company that brings food to you when you cant go get it Cause of covid you cant even get fast food without a car anymore so Uber is a much needed commodity Just dont expect to get a cheese burger chicken andwich some nuggets and 2 tacos for 5 dollars like in the drive threw Youre looking at more like 20+ delivery dont expect things like a biggie bag from Wendys or 2 tacos from jack n box either,4
124,This company is a disgusting money grabber I understand that companies need to make money but the way uber takes advantage of their customers is ridiculous If you enter a destination to see the price and time it would take to reach your destination and then go out the app and back in your ride price will increase and sometimes dramatically Also the fact that if you cancel a ride you will be charged a small fee but if a driver is 10 minutes away and you cancel you still get charged a small fee,1
125,Hey Uber if you want to tell your riders the driver isnt available DO IT BEFORE THE SET TIME FOR A RIDE NOT AFTER I walked to my destination FASTER than you guys could find a ride for me Heck I would be waiting IN THE COLD if I waited and came in LATE to my job Next time Ill uninstall the app before I start walking,1
126,I was never picked up by my uber I watched the uber driver circle the parking lot and then drive off He drove to my destination without me to make it look like he dropped me off and now uber is refusing to refund me I had to walk home and uber doesnt seem to care,1
127,Terrible service and app experience Lyft is faster and a much more pleasant ride Get with the times please,1
128,This app constantly pops up ads so I always have to kill it Its annoying AF Other than that its alright,3
129,By far one of the most irritating experience trying to sign up as a driver for this app Giving me log in issues like no other and no support at all the app freezes in one part of the sign up and no way to fix it or work around it If this is the sign up process i wonder what actually dealing with Uber Id like POS,1
130,Still havent resolved my issue This after numerous emails and contact through Twitter Your customer service is the worst,1
131,This app is alway messing up and I have to login through the website for service Whats the point of having the app,3
132,This app sucks big time None of my scheduled rides show up even close to on time When I order food the drivers will pick up and deliver other orders so my food is almost always cold and wasted And most of the drivers are rude as hell now Youre seriously better off calling a cab costs the same anyways Also I cant get rides half the time anyways,1
133,I want to open this app and have it offer service from where I am not get a map of the world Then you click on the option that takes you to last trip but no where does it offer request a ride 2 of my last 4 attempts to request rides were not mandatory so I simply have up on figuring this out I spend all day online and sell for many others and access many customer sites so not totally illiterate and rarely write reviews Gave up on this today and will look for alternative options,1
134,Awful customer service Had an Uber Eats driver cancel my order while less than 1 block from my place Customer service was no help at all Lyft and Seamless for me from now on,1
135,I would never use Uber if I were you I would use Lyft Uber steals money from your account if you dont take garage with them you better not cancel because the driver canceled on you five times now they got your money cuz the driver canceled and wont give it back its the worst app Ive ever seen in my life,1
136,Updated Jan 2022: I scheduled an airport ride 3 days in advance Driver was 10 mins late and according to the app still was 25 mins away Didnt reply to texts so I canceled and had to drive myself pay for a week of airport parking and almost missed my plane I was charged a cancelation fee which I disputed This is a horrible experience I will never use Uber again  App wont load It just circles,1
137,My experience overall is they have always got me a ride its cheaper than anyone else and when I wasnt happy with something they made it right and that included refunding my money,4
138,The past +10 updates has a glaring issue that isnt adressed When a scheduled trip is in progress the map will not show the trips progress It will just show the map of the world instead of showing the city map drivers location the drivers information and the estimate pickup time This issue even presist after the driver picks you up Heck at the time of this review I got hit with this issue on an unplanned trip This is unsafe,1
139,For the past few years Ive used Uber as my back and forth to work I take the same ride 810x a week It always costs somewhere between $1012 as its only a 7minute drive Uber has started quoting me at $40+ for this ride every day at 4:30AM as surge pricing when there are 0 drivers Taxi for the same ride costs $16 Lyft costs $11 Been Uber Diamond since the loyalty program was released but now deleted the app Lyft actually managed to become the cheaper option Wild reality,2
140,Found out that Ive been paying for Uber pass for months and havent used Uber a single time since signing up Companies these days focus too much on exploiting the fact that people sign up for subscription services and forget I didnt receive a single email text or notification while getting charged every month The app itself works well and smooth hence giving two stars,2
141,I clicked on the same ride over and over again And it kept giving me an error This has happened on a few occasions Every time this happens I open the Lyft app I find the ride to be cheaper and Lyft comes and scoops me on the first try Uber has turned into this automated customer service and its trash Im sure soon after I post this some robot with a name is going to apologize something like thisWe are sorry for the trouble caused We definitely understand your concerns here,1
142,Ive tried multiple ways to call and speak with someone to no avail I was charged $30 twice on my card but cant talk to anyone to resolve the issue 🤦,1
143,When I initially tried booking it wouldnt accept my PayPal account When I went back to select a different option it increased the prices from 2499 to 3999 literally less than 2 minutes after booking my husband found out his parents were driving their car down for us to borrow for a day I Tried to cancel the $3999 ride and Uber wanted to charge me $2000 to cancel Last time I use this service,1
144,Ive been using Uber for years and never had a bad experience until now I just got a new phone and the app is not letting me to log into my account it just stays on the screen where you put your number in  its really frustrating Never had this happen before Ive tried everything I Dont know what else to do Very disappointed,1
145,DONT GIVE YOUR DRIVERS THE ABILITY TO CANCEL TRIPS Lyft actually gives incentives to not cancel a trip but here I am getting cancelled trips over and over on Uber TERRIBLE Make it reflect on their rating if they cancel a lot because i an tired of the constant cancellations because a driver doesnt want to make the drive,1
146,Every time I try to use this app I get to the last step to book a ride and it just says oops something went wrong It doesnt inform me what went wrong or how I can fix anything it just wont do anything I go back hit confirm again same thing I close the app and reopen same thing I clear cache same thing I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it SAME THING Like do you even want my business Ill just switch to lyft theyre much cheaper anyway,1
147,1/3 of the cost of my recent trip was a damn booking fee I guess its time to look to start using lyft,3
148,Uber play too much Super inconsistent app says ride is 10 minutes away but when you request the ride its now 3 minutes away Call for a ride an hour in advance still end up waiting for 45 minutes Uber gets me to work just in time to be late everyday Oh and god forbid the driver has to wait a minute because of all the games they charging extra even if its a penny Wasted the little bit of battery I had trying to request an Uber called a LYFT and was connected in 10 minutes no games,1
149,They charge you a waiting time fee even if THEY were at the wrong address There has been multiple times where they are at my neighbors house and start charging me for waiting Where does it say that you have to look left and right to make sure they arent at your neighbors house Thats not my job You have the correct address and porch light on so you can SEE THE ADDRESS I still get charged Im sick of this No accountability they just charge you and dont refund or try to fix it BS,1
150,This app is unreliable If you need to be somewhere at a certain time give yourself an hour of wiggle time You can have a driver assigned to you and for no reason at all they cancel This will take time for a new driver to be assigned to you Had it happen 5 times in a row before and had to explain to my boss why I am hour late Its normal for someone to take a ride then drop out and your assigned time change again So again this app is not reliable for time sensitive arrival,1
151,Issues fix There were a few issues with loading and missing information that has been fixed,3
152,The drivers suck They take rides while on one and cancel after ten minutes and theres nothing to be done about it Just call a cab,1
153,Its good Its just half the time it has me waiting 15  20 minutes or more for a ride to show up Also they keep linking me up with rides that are 1520 minutes away I wish I could get rides that were closer,3
154,Customer service is a joke I was sent an Uber gift card and tried to use it but Uber charged my credit card instead The app now says the gift card has already been used even though it wasnt I wrote to customer support and for 3 full weeks got form messages back saying were working on it then they closed the ticket with no resolution Seems like just bot responses no real people and not willing to actually resolve customer issues,1
155,Not great if youre looking to schedule a ride greater than 24 hours out Youll be left without a ride every time,2
156,To expensive and really unreliable uber drivers shouldnt be able to pick and choose or cancel after accepting fare  lyft for now till everythings fixed 10s for a 35s Uber fare got me Fd up,1
157,I have two charges for one ride for 1/11 One is $4194 and the other is $4810 Why I guess if your app was any good this might not have happened I had to back out of the app twice to get my address correct and then went back in to schedule the ride PLEASE CANCEL ONE OF THESE CHARGES,1
158,Uber erased my review so here it goes again My wife reserved a ride to the airport a day before The next morning we got a notification from Uber saying the ride was 2 minutes away Were waiting outside for the driver in the designated waiting area with our luggage 2 minutes pass 3 4 5 nothing All of a sudden our ride gets cancelled Now we have to scramble to see who can give us a ride to the airport so we dont miss our flight I do not recommend reserving a ride on Uber,1
159,Horrible app No customer service hidden and fraudulent charges with no one to speak to about getting a refund Robotic scammers No safety background checks are a joke drivers have felony records and lend out their accounts to others Save yourself the headache and just order a regular taxi or town car Theyre cheaper these days anyway and you get to deal with actual human beings,1
160,Stop giving me advertising notifications If it isnt for a ride that I specifically open your app to order but I dont want to see any of your notifications I dont care if theres a cheap ride going on right now if Im not looking to get a ride from you guys youre just annoying me Keep this up and Ill have to uninstall the app just to get you to stop,1
161,I have had so many incredibly difficult experiences and would never ever use Uber again if there was an acceptable alternative Just now I was charged a small waiting fee which was the fault of my driver He waited at the wrong address in spite of my texting him the correct one Getting help of any kind to address horrendous problems is virtually impossible In all monetary differences they always win I feel violated and helpless to protect myself from their abuse,1
162,Uber is such a great app I always got such great deals like a $025 cents ride It was especially nicer than taking the bus My only complaint was during Halloween one time my ride kept cancelling on me per request At the time I only had $25 and per cancellation Uber takes $5 from your credit card The uber drivers accepted my request 5 times and cancelled it taking every last dollar I had and I had to walk home that day But that nice $025 cent deal Uber earns 5 stars Thanks a lot,5
163,While using in Mexico two separate times so far it has stopped working and had multiple errors essentially leaving me stranded Its ruining my time as Im afraid to go anywhere in case i cant get back again I could see the cars near me on the map it almost worked once in the two hours I was trying and I had just used it successfully 4 hours earlier No payment issues and the website has no information about why it would continually have an error in processing your request,1
164,Impossible to get a ride at times no matter what time of day sometimes i have to wait an hour to get a ride because i will have like 45 drivers cancel before i finally get a driver to accept the ride that doesnt cancel half way thru Sucks we get charged if we cancel a ride but drivers can cancel after they have accepted the ride make us wait 20 mins showing they are on their way only to cancel at the last minute then i have to go throught the whole process of looking for another driver,1
165,Really bad Im using the uber 6 month and spent a lot of money for nothing they take 30 minutes plus always wrong address this is really stupid,1
166,The Uber app and Uber Eats app is useless if you have an issue as there is no way to resolve it Ive had a handful of issues since I started using the services in the last 6 years and there is not a way to contact customer service The app provides very limited feedback options which have never been applicable to the issue I would need to resolve which has resulted in charges to me that should not be charged Its immensely frustrating shows that they dont value their customers or improvement,1
167,Rides constantly cancel at the last minute leaving me having to wait longer to get another one and frequently the app shows the driver is close only to switch drivers and making them even farther away Had one ride cycle me through 4 drivers once Totally unreliable and a waste of money,1
168,Scheduled several hours in advance and the app didnt bother to tell me that there wasnt anyone that had accepted It just said pickup time soon even 8 minutes past the window Wasnt charged for cancelation but did have to find a different ride If theres no drivers it should say so before the pickup window ends There was no option for help with a current ride,2
169,Uber is great for a ride and food delivery and from what Ive been told pays there drivers a little better than Lyft Worst part spam notifications I cam get all notifications silently or disable all notifications including the important ones I dont need uber telling me I can get a ride today or whats new Keep that stuff inside the app,5
170,Since the last update Uber has gotten MUCH more aggressive about trying to track my location in the background even when I havent used the app in over a month Fortunately Ive got tools to detect and block that sort of malicious activity but most people dont I would highly recommend going into your phones settings and revoking the apps location permissions whenever youre not using it or even better uninstalling it entirely if you know its going to be a while,2
171,Ive never even used the app and when I really needed it  it wouldnt work (my car was gone and I had to visit my dentist) Ive installed the app for the first time in my life and it asked for my phone number So I entered my number but it told me that my account was disabled (IVE NEVER EVEN CREATED ONE) Okay no problem I use my second phone number but no results Really disappointed,2
172,Cannot link my PayPal account The app will not save my home address as a saved place Im trying to set this up for my mom since there are no taxi cabs in the area anymore and her car keeps breaking down Idk how uber is in business with such a poor non functioning app,1
173,The app is great for getting rides It is garbage for contacting Uber with a generic issue There is no contact us form There is no Other type of help request For example if their survey email has links that wont work you cannot tell them their links are broken from gmail Who knows maybe theyll read this YOU NEED A WAY TO CONTACT YOU WITH GENERIC REQUESTS,1
174,2nd update (2/2/22) WTH is up with Uber setting me up with drivers who dont show up 11 minutes turns into 22 minutes and the map doesnt update And now I gotta pay a fee because they never moved What a waste of time and money BIG TIME Ugh,1
175,I set a pickup time to go to the airport in the morning walked outside 5 minutes before the time and no one showed I recieved a notification stating the driver cancelled and i was charged a fee This app and drivers are garbage karma will catch you soon,1
176,Just use lyft these guys are the worst when it comes to account reclamation If you get locked out your account by someone else they have no way to fix it without logging in which is exactly what you cant do Customer service is awful I was told I would be connected to an expert and four days later Im still waiting To top it all off I just caved and decided to make a new account but I cant because they dont allow transfering of phone numbers You know what customer service said Nothing,1
177,So if you live on the outskirts of the city prepare to be cancelled all the time I cannot tell you how many times this service has failed me in the one way its designed to help I live just out the busier side of the cityEverytime I get a driver the app promises me Ill make my destination in a timely manner I get charged say its 20+ min for my ride and that my ETA for work is now longer and potentially making me late and I wait Then the driver cancels and says its not worth his time,1
178,I wish there was a way to NOT GIVE U ANY STARSbecause truly your service was unnaceptable Not only did the app tell me conflicting info about what was going on with pick upYOU AUTOMATICALLY CHARGED MY BANK CARD 35$ WHEN THE FARE WAS ONLY 16$ You actually tried to attain cash for both these transactions and i dont understand where the 35$ came up If i do the mathit would cost me 51$ to go 3 miles Outrageous This is my very first time writing a negative review Shame on u for deceit,1
179,It has been almost a year since I reported a lost iPad I reach the driver and he told me he wont return it and i could report him as many times as I want uber support wont do anything He was right I never got an email reply for an update The only replies I got was when I sent an email asking again After telling them the driver was not willing to return it they put me in contact with him Im 2 weeks would be a year Uber support  Not for their customers thats for sure,1
180,Often when I open the app all I see is a map I cant order a ride and there is no option in the app to get help with this I end up having to take a cab off the street which defeats the purpose of having the app You can never get anyone from the company to help you They need to have a section for app issues in the app,1
181,I recently changed my payment option On the weekend when my daughter was at the mall and was trying to get a ride it declined my card Although I know that the card works Monday evening my son tries to get a ride from work and guess what again it said decline I tried using different payment options that I have listed including two other credit cards and my PayPal account and its still declined I did what customer service adjusted and updated the app And it actually made it worse,1
182,It seems that now it pulls drivers that are 15 minutes plus away when there have been multiple drivers closer that it decides to not offer me I had 2 18 minutes away not accept me then it gave me someone 4 minutes away It used to never do this it has just become garbage with how it decides what drivers I get now The driver that was 4 minutes away told me for some reason he was getting riders 20 minutes away It just makes no sense,1
183,I live close to downtown close to the university and yet I still can never seem to find a driver most of the time When I do I wait 20 minutes just to have them cancel when they finish theyre current drop off This app is useless Ill be trying your competition now I hope Uber goes bankrupt,1
184,Great drivers Poor GPS given by Uber itself You guys always find a route to get me to work slow Even the drivers mention that theres a shorter way but they cant do that cause of the way yall set the GPS up This is not a game ppl got stuff to do,2
185,I ordered an uber one day and it had said 12 minutes for like 10 minutes And I can see the guy on the map was just not moving so you guys should do something about things like that Also it takes forever for the ride to confirm I ordered uber around 3:20 it took till 3:30 for the rider to confirm And once it did it said driver was 23 minutes away but when I ordered it it was 13 minutes away Just so stupid,1
186,This app has become useless garbage For the past few months only a handful of my trips have went through All others get oops something went wrong I cant usey $15 monthly credit so its just being wasted Please fix this This used to be such a great and reliable app,1
187,app is i pretty good recently Ive been having two issues: * I schedule rides pretty often but even when Ive scheduled a ride the app will pop up a notification telling me about how I can get a ride with one tap about three times its annoying enough to get an ad but the app should know that I already have a ride * when I open the app for the first time on a given day there seems to be a 50/50 chance it gets stuck on a white screen simply restarting the app fixes the issue,3
188,I had a scheduled ride canceled due to no drivers being available While I completely understand that what ISNT acceptable is that I was only notified five minutes AFTER my scheduled pickup window It would have been far easier and given me more time to find alternate transport if I had been notified ten minutes before my window when it started telling me to get ready for pickup,2
189,It shouldnt force me the same driver if ive already canceled with them At first this app was easy and usable but now as soon as i try to scheduele a ride or cancel it either glitches out and doesnt allow me to give a rating or tip or even just flat out sends me to the same uber it also glitches out and doesnt show where my driver actually is so i dont know which 20+ cars is meant to be my uber Doesnt help that the map system is absolute garbage too leaving my driver always confused,1
190,i cant believe my uber experience has gotten worse but it sure has the app is so glitchy now it freezes CONSTANTLY sometimes doesnt let me tip drivers without going back out of the app and drivers make you wait 1520+ minutes before canceling on you its so ridiculous and frustrating having to rely on a barely functioning service i had a driver drive through my yard  over an embankment with me in the car and i couldnt even get a refund on my ride for damage  reckless driving,1
191,Uber has gone way downhill When the service began it was convenient and affordable Unfortunately neither of those hold true today I have often used Uber for transportation to the airport Several times recently Ive scheduled an early morning trip the night before to ensure I arrive on time Then minutes before my pickup window begins Im connected with a driver that will not arrive anywhere close to my pickup window At this point Uber will charge you for wasting your drivers time,2
192,Good luck trying to find a ride on time anywhere around your cityConstantly late and or nobody shows up when I give a good 30 min window to get to my destination The apps pricing is buggy to say the least wait 30 seconds and youll go from $13 to $38 An absolute liability if you need a ride anywhere,1
193,I needed a ride to the airport for me and my family I tried for nearly an hour to set up a payment method I tried three different credit cards PayPal and Venmo I kept getting different error messages Something went wrong or we cannot accept this payment method and another I cant remember I tried both on the app and on my web browser I deleted all payment methods and tried again Finally I switched to Lyft and got my ride set up in 5 minutes,1
194,Oops something went wrong is all I get no matter what I do Ive been using Uber for many years but now I can never get the App to work It takes you through all the option up to finding your ride then Oops something went wrong I rely on uber for these $100 dollar airport rides that use to be $50 2 years ago but I cant even do that now From a very frustrated user in the Los Angeles area,1
195,Fix your damned app Bad enough it takes forever to get a driver to take the ride but then it is dropped and I have to find out later looking through the help section the driver saw my pick up points as places I did not select This is part of the reason I have grown to hate uber Buggy application interface in order to hopefully get service and sometimes lucky you get service at all not under a surge at the time,1
196,Unusable I need to verify my Im supposed to text GO to a specific number But when I do it comes back as a non valid number So Im completely unable to use this app because the only way to verify it is to send go to a number that does not work or even register as a correct number,1
197,I like to see the map when I request a ride Then I just recently updated my app all I get is a picture of cartoon face etc,4
198,Prices surges are ridiculous and are often for no reason The so called price protection which is supposed to prevent price surges is inconsistent and theres no email or phone number that allows you to contact them about it And now it wont let me order Ubers despite the app being up to date,1
199,Still too expensive Also they need to lay off of emailing us feedback inquiries I got repeated emails about the same thing for a few days apart These companies really know how to piss people off Before Covid I was able to get to LA over 14 miles away for under $10 Now its really inflated around $30 what a load of BS,2
200,Untrustworthy app Drivers cancel too often They can take your money and you just get left with no ride and out the cost Not worth it just use one of the other ride services They love to respond promptly and positive on here but treat you differently when its one on one Standard garbage app protocol,1
201,You cant cancel Uber Pass from the app This is one of the worst apps Ive seen from a major company It looks like 2010 It gives you few options to do anything besides order a ride Just a horrible company Would never use them unless i had no other choice,1
202,Service is OK Discounts are nonexistent After spending hundreds of my uber points for uber x 20% off discounts I am disgusted at CS and uber for not fixing this problem I have written several times to inapp CSRs who send me some lame email but dont refund my points or my $ I am quitting uber and just take public trans i will save alot of $ Thanks but no thanks you guys suck in CS and helping a dedicated customer who has spent thousands on cabs these last few years,2
203,This app is HORRIBLE So many bugs The payments never work and when they do they trick you into adding more money to your account than you want The app is littered with bugs your driver will cancel on you after an hour of waiting This app is literal garbage,1
204,Ive about had it with this apps algorithm Dropped from a constant 495 maintained for 3 yrs to a 484 no matter the tips compliments and being on time (even 30 minutes ahead) since I only use this service to get to work and back its subpar service not being able to see rider feedback so you can at least improve Second whenever you need something from the app its always through another misc category Ive had better app service and options through Alto and Lyft Uninstalling,2
205,I am old school and think that way When someone does the job right then that is just it right or 3 stars Now on the other hand if they go above and beyond then and only then does it merrit 4 or 5 stars But Uber like so many others out there want you to complain for any thing less than 5 stars That is just to lay blame when there is none to blame The result is simple never give any rating that you do not think it deserves there is one reason i do not give feedback or rate people,3
206,Uber will find almost any reason to squeeze money out of you Not only did they hike my price up multiple dollars *less than a minute* after my initial search they charged me a waiting fee when the cab arrived *less than a minute* after I ordered it I live in a 6 story walkup with no elevator The only way I could have made it on time is if I flung myself out the window and landed on the hood But this is an app rating so Im giving it two stars for how difficult it is to file a complaint,2
207,Most of the time its a Wonderful experien I have had a few times that I wish Id NEVER Tabed you in my apps You some times make things to confusing in the get a Ride APP (Im disabled  Ive had a stroke ) but overall your GOOD  YOUR DRIVERS COULD BE A LITTLE BIT KINDER AND TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT SOME OF US WITH DISABILITY ARE VERYVERY SLOW WIRH ARE WALKING,4
208,This app is not worth it go to Lyft The UI lags a lot and is prone to lots of glitches you cant really pick a time in advance so it will cost less and the surges raise the prices near double than what youd have to pay using Lyft For example a short drive to my job would cost me 15$ whereas they want a full 30$ to and back Thats 60 dollars or more depending on how high the surge is every day you use this You also get charged more the longer youre on the road No thanks ,1
209,Needs a major company overhaul Clearly Uber doesnt apply the feedback from these websites to improve The service is not as safe as it was when it started The app and website arent easy to use and the drivers can lock the riders into a pick up that they actually never show up for There is very little protection for the riders and the company is not ethical when it comes to charging and refunding You cant get a refund if your driver accepts but never shows This is a really common issue,2
210,This app Sucks When you Order Food its really hard to cancel it Or add things on it After a few seconds and your charged with another delivery cost just for adding something Their app also changes if you walk anywhere or cross the Street This app is all about getting you to spend more money with as many hidden fees you fall for Its always hard to change your destination and thats another fee So be awhere of all the well hidden Fees I was charged over $60 for a delivery Lyft is much B,1
211,Your app is broken and needs to be fixed I cant schedule a ride ahead of time I keep getting an error screen I have had friends try from multiple locations and they are also having issues Fix it,1
212,Everytime I did a ride it keeps updating and I am losing my money yall need to fix drivers or fix yall app You have good drivers but changing amount of price got to change,2
213,We are elderly disabled and have no transportation My husband used Uber a couple of times no problem Uber driver took him to his barber shop He waited outside on the elements for 2 and 1/2 hours No one ever showed up We were charged 2 no shows on our card and my husband never left the sidewalk waiting for 2 separate drivers who never showed up Would like to get Uber driver for another ride for my husband to be taken to the doctor at 9am but dont want to get ripped off again,1
214,Uber has switched maps and is now often innacurate Our home address is now shown over a block from its actual location (both Google and Apple get it right) This has become a huge hastle especially with pickups but also with dropoffs We had to help the driver tonight who was completely confused The real low point is there is no way to provide this sort of feedback in the updated app Switching to Lyft If you are considering whether to choose Uber or Lyft go with Lyft ,1
215,Scheduling rides in advance is not a good feature if they arent going to be on time I had a ride that was going to be for 17:30 and my uber canceled on me and now I have to wait more time for another one to come which pushes back my schedule I have also have had a bad experience with one of the drivers touching me inappropriately and uber couldnt do anything about it other than refund my ride but he is still driving out there and I wish that they would be more on time,2
216,Every time I request a ride it says an error has occurred and it still charges me No nevermind I get the money back by the end of the day why am I being charged if your app fails to work Why is it even failing in the first place,1
217,In time to pick up for a ride  on time when drop off Just like ur riding on ur on time vehicle Great Only from last year 2020 adding extra charges minutes charge when driver waiting time If get traffic Xtra charges Hoping wont way over too much or else will same charge as taxi cab Just as ease fair enough,4
218,This is the worst app for scheduling future pickups I have ever used I tried 4 times to schedule a ride at 8:15am the next day Every time they switched it to 8:15pm I was scheduling an uber for my doctors visit in the morning By the time the morning came prices jumped from $24 to $64 and I couldnt afford it anymore I had to cancel my doctors appointment and reschedule for Feb (soonest time) So thanks uber for ruining a poor sick autistic kids life,1
219,This app does its job for me but I get irritated about estimated delivery times for food when the restaurant isnt even that far away And then when I order rides it doesnt charge my card for days which you think would be nice but actually doesnt allow me to know how much I have left to spend on my card for other things,3
220,Always have to wait forever to be picked up Needs to do better and pay drivers better so more will be out,3
221,Bait and switch with out of nowhere changes to fares before you have a chance to order I had a $20 ride become $65 just before I ordered it because of demand Weird I got a ride from Lyft for $15 and it took much less time Ps fix your survey links that actually just try to get you on the Uber website when you havent needed a ride in awhile in order to buy a ridesomewhere Who just buys a ride for the hell of it anyway Why try to convince me to ride when I have no need,1
222,They opened an arena across the street from my apartment and now I cant get picked up inside a 5 block radius around my own home Very inconvenient and no reason for it what so ever I could understand if it was before a game or event at the arena but its constant No warning from uber that I wouldnt be able to be picked up from my home address anymore Seems like the kind of thing you should tell customers in advance Oh and theres no where to report this kind of issue besides here lmao,1
223,Very useful for truckers to get out of the truck I had to update my review Do Not get a bad Uber gift card because the company will run you around have you jump through hoops and then do Nothing to help you claim the money on the card,4
224,I just recently signed up with this company and I am not able to edit my pickup location I have wasted much time trying to follow the directions and it is not easy to navigate at all And there is no contact us even with an email and I am to be at the airport at 4:00 am in the morning in about 15 hours I am still trying to navigate how to edit my trip so as not to have to cancel for a cost but navigating the few steps to do so is extremely difficult and not clear and precise,2
225,Ive been using Uber and UberEats for over 5 years and had a few issues over the years missing orders etc But for the past few weeks I keep getting error msgs when I try to order food or request a ride I contacted customer support who then transferred me to a specialist team who then told me they cant resolve the issue So I guess Ill have to stick to lyft and doordash I wish I could share screenshots of how priority support just ignores my questions and their vague responses to problem,2
226,Uber in bd is unusable I rarely write Reviews But this app made me so mad that I am on it The car drivers consistently ask where to go If they Dont want to go they will make you wait for 10 min then they cancel Few more times then I have to bare surge price  Its their way to misuse the surge system I am disappointed Pathao is way more reliable ,1
227,This is the worst app ever I added money to my wallet and I book a ride multiple times because kept saying that something was wrong with my ride or whatever and they still charge me like 5 times I swear I will never use this again ever in my life You guys dont even deserve a star to be honest The only regret I have is for trusting in you guys,1
228,Its should always have the option to search for a new uber driver when the one selected is too far away No one wants to pay high prices and wait too long for an Uber to arrive Specifically when youre short in time The high prices makes you not want give quality tip to the drivers either That should be fixed aswell,3
229,Granted the rides at this time (6am) are typically busier I was prepared to wait a little bit but today Ive waited for about 2 hours for this app to find a ride and still havent found one They need to make drivers take rides when someone has waited this long or have the people thats waited be on the top priority Its not that theres no drivers available either Worst experience and Ive never had a problem using uber for the last 2 years Definitely disappointed,2
230,I update the app and now they charge so much to schedule rides My trip shouldnt cost 4 times as much just because I scheduled it in advance They never used to do this before this is completely ridiculous,1
231,I use to remember using this app alot when you really need a ride home or to far destination it was cheap to call uber 510min drive was cheap now its $60300 for 10 min drive even with pandemic there is no excuse for skyrocket prices unless its car that transforms to gold airplane and all fancy food inside then its worth it  refunds > hah no 4 days later then you get back uber credits instead no matter how bad drivers are you lose in the end 39 stars should be 005stars,3
232,I have been trying to reach out to them via email since they have no phone number one of their drivers tried to scan me today crash my app now I cant get in and cant get ahold of anyone this has been the worst experience Ive had dealing with a ride sharing company Uber should be ashamed of themselves As a result missed my flight cost me 300 dollars to reschedule flight Guess I wont be using Uber or Uber eats anymore,1
233,Not very good for use internationally it worked for a day and then out of the blue started not accepting any payment methods I confirmed with my banks that I had cards and funds that should have been working but uber continually refused to accept them Had to spend much of a night on the streets in a dangerous part of town because of issues with uber Would never use or recommend,1
234,Perhaps add prompt upon entering car for rider to notify drivers of issues where language barrier exists EX If I see an issue I can click the issue in English on uber and the driver sees the issue restated in their app in their language Im all for equal employment opportunity for those who do not speak much English but its stressful to be blamed for a telling a driver the seat was wet and he couldnt understand me Had a great Friday night but stressed the entire following day w/ $150 fee,3
235,I was charged more then what was shown to me I would have never paid $30 for a 9 minute trip but the app has no options that I can find to contact support The app just says I was shown the price but it wasnt that price but I cant continue disputing it at all I would like to just be charged the usual $1699 for my ride not the $30 that I was incorrectly charged,1
236,Have had a few drivers cancel rides and thats fine What is not fine is if have to make other arrangements after the driver cancelling and I dont feel like waiting another 10 minutes I have to pay a cancellation fee Thats garbage Now instead Ill use Uber less and less and just plan ahead Uber used to be efficient and convenient Its far from that now Ive been riding for 10 years and Ive seen it go downhill very quick It doesnt seem to be easy to use as it once was,2
237,Unusable because they are liars Quote 78 minutes then after taking your payment your ride is 20+ minutes away If rides are taking longer thats understandable Just be honest about it Stop bait and switching its illegal,1
238,I use Uber twice a day 5 days a week so you make a lot of money off me Since youve updated your app so your drivers can now see what they will make for each trip it has been hard for me to get a ride I have to sit and wait 20 to 30 minutes to get to work or get home You need to change it Update 1/6/22 I just had 2 drivers cancel on me This is ridiculous Now Im gonna be late for work,1
239,App just stopped working a few weeks ago Continually getting an Oops something went wrong message when I try to confirm a ride No where in the apps Help section does it prompt you about issues with the app so obviously Uber doesnt care about customer support Literally forcing me to use their competitor apps nice one bozos ,1
240,I ordered I ride I tried canceling when it was still searching for drivers but the cancel button would not work then it showed that a driver would arrive in 20 mins I tried canceling many times but to no avail I tried messaging the driver that he shouldnt come he told me that he cant cancel I have to do it he ended up driving all the way then I requested a refund my card was charged then I got the refund In Uber cash (which I have no use for) still very unfair for the driver,1
241,Drivers are allowed to accept your ride then cancel You get charged anyway Support claims its temporary and drops off Nope The charges post Adding new card payments began failing regardless of card Support is awful and nonexistent Avoid this company,1
242,App is good but today I set my location to be pick up at home after a while waiting I noticed my location pick up was change to my destination a need it to cancel and requested a new ride,3
243,Driver accepted ride then called and said he had car trouble and I needed to cancel the ride(why wouldnt he cancel the ride) When rebooking at that exact time price was 4 times higher Checked again 10 minutes later price back down to normal I feel let down with no ride and mislead Its 2pm on a Monday I doubt there is a rush for Uber right now so why the price hike for 10 minutes when I needed a car At least I had the ability to not travel and just reschedule and not getting gouged,1
244,You guys take way too long to find people drivers I order my ride 30 minutes before I start work and I dont get a ride till ten minutes before I have to be at work resulting in my being late for work You say theirs drivers nearby but you take forever to connect me to one,1
245,Prices are insane Just a few weeks agoI was payong $2025 for my trip Now they are trying to charge 40+might as wellget a taxi Update This is happening again and the rewards for uber now cost a ridiculous amount of points This is not during surge times Uber is just charging me more for the same rides,1
246,Way too expensive If anyone opens a reliable transportation business you guys are in trouble because this is not reliable and far too expensive,1
247,Why bother to schedule in advance Scheduled pick up for 810am by 840 driver was still in the same location 132 miles away which was 27 minutes The time they were supposed to be to my location just kept getting farther out The driver never moved from original location I cancelled pickup scheduled with Lyft they were there in 5 minutes and it was 1/3 of the price Uber still charged me even though the driver never was on the way Be aware of this scam,1
248,When it has finally been debugged simple and great transportation,5
249,When I try to upload gift cards to my account it says something went wrong try again that was 5 days ago and they wont reimburse me or put the funds on my account,1
250,Its crazy how late it tells you about this booking fee it has when your already charging me too much as is And then there is no way to contact anyone about it I use Uber a lot and never had a booking fee before and then the price increase in just a few minutes This app is getting worst and worst,1
251,I could not see a trip I booked and it was cancelled by the driver That was $26 wasted I dont like how inconspicuously Uber books the trip so I lost that money because I couldnt see where to access my booked trips and thought maybe I already canceled it For such a high noshow fee youd think theyd do better at showing your trip information with some sort of notification and a button that actually says booked trips Now im not tipping during future trips just to soften the blow,1
252,Worked great for two rides After that they denied my payment methods and after contacting support (might I add I was redirected to email support from mobile) they told me I violated their terms of service without even telling me how I did and terminated my account I will be going with Lyft for any rides I schedule in the future and will recommend against this company due to my experience,1
253,Doesnt allow me to update my card and when inputting a new card refuses to acknowledge it even exists no matter how many times you click on it Also doesnt allow you to delete cards Also didnt save my new card So now Im sitting at home late for work because nowhere in the app does it provide assistance,1
254,Used this app years ago and it was great However whatever changes were made recently it is not accepting any of my payment methods Ultimately frustrating as I needed a ride for a time sensitive matter and could not book a ride Will be deleting This app is just taking up space in my phone now,2
255,The app could use a lot of improvement One time the same trip gives the closest route whereas the next trip it takes you 10 miles out of your way Also there is no way to give constructive feedback to drivers without dogging their score and just selecting just a preset issue,2
256,Worst experience ever tried requesting for rides app kept saying went something wrong and keep on doing that since we were relying on uber to get home after the bar Fortunately town has some cab services and got a ride this app needs work internet was fine was no issue from our side,1
257,Aweful service Software bugs result in fraud The software wont always let you request to have a fraudulent drivers charges reviewed Then when time runs out they say both sorry they cant help you because time ran out and they tell you to apply for a fare review within the app which is idiotic because it clarifies that they they are not reading what you wrote Customer service bots or the service is no better than if they used bots Use über to be defrauded,1
258,I primarily use UberEATS for food I cant get to (I live pretty far from restaurants) It is unbelievably ANNOYING to 1 Order something and get the wrong order 2Rude drivers (to me or the store employees) 3 The driver EATS MY FOOD Then I get a refund but no real way to get in contact with the driver so its always going to be a gamble if/when my correct order gets here I give nice tips for mediocre service Tldr Dont use UberEats Use GrubHub or some other app,2
259,Its good and all but sometimes they charge a big some of money when the distance is not that far away then say that they will give that money back to you but then they actually dont and sometimes when you make a schedule the uber wont pop up then they charge u anyway,3
260,I like Uber in general but at the end of my trip when opened up the email I tried to select Add a tip The app would not send me to a screen to add a tip though I was able to rate the driver (5 stars),4
261,Screw uber eats Literally the worst app on the planet The UI is confusing and unclear Going back on Android does not work properly I have to close the app an reopen it to go back Additionally I cant cancel my order It says there is a way to cancel it but I cant find it Not to mention that the food is insanely overpriced This app and everything about it is a case study about the inherent greed and evil in humans,1
262,This review is specifically based on Ubers grocery delivery service It was so bad and I gave them so many chances that I refuse to use them all together They gave me a $10 credit and just completely didnt deliver the order that I used it on and said they were sorry and that was all they can do So sorry this is all I can do,1
263,This app has a really realiancy issue The uprupt cancellations really effect my work life and find Lyft to be more reliable even when I use the schedule function Today I attempted to order food from the Uber eats side My first order I never got I tried to contact the person but they hung up on me The second time I tried to order food with in 6 mins of the order being placed he canceled,2
264,Very happy to see these ratings get tanked Dont bother getting Uber anymore Its dead There are no drivers its scalping what few customers it has for every penny and you have to pay $30 extra to schedule a ride ahead of time when Lyft only charges $5 extra Uber is absolutely horrible Do not support them,1
265,Horrible app update No thanks App wasnt user friendly with my galaxy Beyond pissed off about my service with the app  I tried and tried Ended up walking to my location in 15 degree weather Rather hitchhike way home This is the last time I use uber Lyft app worked fine last week,1
266,Wow this app ease of use has tanked severely in the past few years Cant add profile picture rather important for server safety they should drop food stop greed and just drive Sheesh To think I drove at one time Awful interface and errors galore Feel for the Poor drivers Cant add any favs except where I thought about going during set up and further extra stops Not good at all,1
267,Idiotic platform Wasted 40 minutes of my time by not connecting me to drivers who wanted to drive me to a destination No way to address this as well,1
268,Can no longer see/view family members when they are on a trip Fix this asap,1
269,Update: 1 star now I had to be at a very very important meeting at 12:30 Set my pick up time for 12:15 as it was less than a 10 min drive (Its v cold where I live and cant walk outside) I ended up being connected with a driver over 20 minutes away FINALLY at 12pm I was 30 minutes late to my meeting due to this Uber is utterly incompetent and needs to be shut down It also charges ridiculous amounts at seemingly random If theres that much of a driver shortage just shut down the app ffs,1
270,Ive been using uber for years Never had an issue until now I seen over 200 dollars taken out of my account Jan 16 22 I was confused because I never made an order recently with them I then go and ask them whats the charges about The customer service agent said that they didnt charge me for two orders back in October and November of last year because they had system issues Like are you guys serious Its been 24 hours and no response as yet Come to find out its a double charge smh,1
271,The driver asked me of the PIN I didnt turned on the feature Thats fine I turned on but the pin didnt show up The driver also tried to typed my phone digits not working I lost 10min In the end I cancelled the trip and got late for my doctor appointment This is terrible,1
272,I have been navigating through any/ and or all these different apps for uber ONLY trying to put the app back on my phone for my mothers upcoming doctors appointment This was absolutely crazy Strenuous and rediculous The app wont download to my phone because it has the first app which is uber eats on my phone and therefore IT WILL NOT LET ME AND I CANNOT FIND THE SECTION OF HOW TO UPLOAD GIFT CARDS,1
273,Friendly great driver was hospitable and helpful with luggage,5
274,so I cant even get a ride or order food it just keeps telling me to update my payment method which I did several times now it just tells me oops something went wrong try again later I still have about 40 dollars on this app and I want it back if this isnt fixed,1
275,At first it shows me all the available drivers and options I have so it seems to be working then Everytime I try to confirm the ride the app closes so I cant confirm anything and I end up with no ride/driver Absolutely frustrating App dosent work,1
276,Periodically at updates Fubars payments Last time I noticed Google pay as an option Was that there or a new thing Google pays Uber to accidentally default y 2 Lacking ANY support if u arent IT savvy my wife Leaves u stranded Dont help they now allow drivers to dump u before pickup if they find a ride that pays more and report it as whatever they feel like no mask not there ,1
277,Says it faster at getting you rides but whenever I use lyft its cheaper and faster The price has went up And takes way to long to find a ride and when I do tip the driver I open app back up its asking me to tip the driver again It will ask me 3x to tip the driver,3
278,Ive been using Uber for over two years I know fare prices fluctuate from time to time But now due to Higher than normal customers the fares have nearly quadrupled $48 for a 2 1/2 mile trip Absolutely ridiculous Sounds a bit like price gouging to me,2
279,Dont trust them Theyll charge a fine and if you prove theyre wrong they change the reason I was fined $40 for my paymenteven though it went throughproved it and then they changed the reason to making a mess in the carwhich I didnt still waiting for pictures of the mess,1
280,Requesting a ride was very easy the Uber driver arrived as expected Everything was smooth until 10 minutes into the ride Our driver was very drowsy heavy eyes falling asleep at the wheel My husband striked up a conversation with him on two different occasions to keep him awake Later in the day we got an adjustment on our bill and the driver added a $40 cleaning fee for a gum wrapper left on the floor from my kids,1
281,Not a fan I regularly choose Uber green as a rider and get cars like fossilfueled hybrid Toyota Camry it gets 30 miles per gallon of *fossil fuel* Thats not green thats greenwashing I use Uber when my electric car is in the shop because they give me Uber credits Your response is inadequate I dont want you deep diving me I want an a car with no emissions when I choose a green ride not a car that is ultimately a fossil fueled polluter and Im saying so in public Minus another ,1
282,Noticed fraudulent charges on credit card for an unauthorized subscription Uber help refused to refund and was only willing to give a credit in the app The subscription charges dont appear anywhere in your account on the app you can only see actual charges on your billing statement,1
283,This app hasnt worked for me the last six months When I try the final step to confirm my ride the reply is Oops something went wrong Try again later After about six tries I give up and use Lyft,2
284,Awful treatment of drivers  Every time I try to tip my driver the app crashes Something went wrong BS All that went wrong was me trying to put money in the pocket of the driver who safely drove me to my destination Ridiculous,1
285,Raising your prices an extra $1520 just because its busy is ridiculous U er was supposed to be a cheaper alternative to taking cabs but now theyre worse than tha cabs Done with Uber yall suck now,1
286,Im unable to get the receipt in English for reimbursement It doesnt help even if Ive removed all other nonEnglish languages in language settings of my device and google account and uninstalled/reinstalled Uber app I guess Lyft is the only choice for my business trips,1
287,Oh wow So many bad reviews Ive always used Lyft but i found out that Lyft robs their drivers and Uber robs them less I always tip cash to try to compensate but i decided to try Uber for the first time The app gets stuck in the loading mode after i hit get started Ive updated Ive waited and waited and waited watching that little circle go around and around trying to catch itself for eternity This must be devastating for all the drivers who are not connecting w their rides,1
288,Well never used this before but I think these are good for getting u to bus station on time and there costs are hi in somethings right,4
289,Uper services in Istanbul was really bad especially on Saturday and Sunday the drivers asking for extra money sometimes double of the meter,1
290,Lately it wont let me use the cash I already have in my wallet Im trying to get a ride right now and its not going through or even reading my location correctly First half from september 2020 I got a new phone and the cash was gone when I signed in Its back after a while but gosh I was furious Its ok other than that I guess,2
291,In app texting doesnt work to try and tell the driver where you are if its hard to call ,3
292,Dont rely on Uber to get you anywhere in a timely fashion It doesnt matter if you schedule six hours ahead for a driver to come itll cancel or say theres no one out (which is doubtful in a city as big as this) And this isnt because I live somewhere hard to reach or anything I literally live on Main Street Im right in the middle of everything Its good for if youre not in any kind of rush but if you want to be there by a certain time account for way more than driving time,2
293,Im late to work today for the first time ever because the app wont accept my perfectly fine card and nothing it said on the Help page fixed it,5
294,I literally have not clicked on this APP in over 6 months Surprisingly I got a charge they could not find the charge even with the account number trans number and photo evidence Ive filed 3 times Amazing how being inactive creates charges with this app,1
295,I was continually charged for things I didnt purchase and then today I was charged $100 Im deleting the app and I want a refund They take money out your account when they want its ridiculous and unreasonable,1
296,Uber rides are just fine But never order food from this app I guarantee you that you will ALWAYS be missing something I never get my drinks at all,2
297,Uber itself is great website and app are eye appealingeasy to use However the drivers Ive had50% chance to have a bad experience my history of 6 yrs continue to get drivers canceling lying saying they picked me up and didnt (which means you cant get another uber until they stop driving all over the city) have had driver refuse my ride pick me up w/ random people in the car driving their own route and getting lost blaring music text and drive Why do I keep taking ubers No choice,2
298,The app developers should be ashamed of themselves Too many glitches I cannot use the 2wheel feature anymore Completely crashed Customer support is even worse Put in several requests and they said I should contact Lime Contacted Lime and they said its a glitch with the Uber app,1
299,Worst experience Unreliable time Booked a ride in Richmond was canceled twice Then again in Orlando book in advance waited for 55 minutes map location of driver and time keeps expending Cannot connect with drivers Then the driver dropped me at the wrong hotel because their map doesnt coincide with Google maps,1
300,After installing the app scheduling a ride  giving my card info for the almost $28 it was going to cost to go from Chico to Manette AND receiving a confirmation that my ride was bookedI stood out in the freezing cold watching the time tick away til my driver was due to pick me up As the countdown clock hit 00:00 mins til pickup I got a msg arriving soon Id been waiting 20 mins The app continued saying arriving soon for 15 more mins then I got a msg sorry no drivers available ,1
301,Uber will not let you use what you put in your wallet for your uber cash balance to reserve a ride Then they double charged me Still has not reversed both charges They owe me $30,1
302,Not great Drivers will regularly pull up to pick you up and then drive away without stopping  or accept the ride and then drive in the opposite direction instead of picking you up for 15 minutes hoping you cancel the ride so they can keep the money Be prepared to wait 10 or 15 minutes for a car then have it not pick you up then wait another 10 or 15 minutes for the next car,2
303,Very very unsat customer support I called customer support about someone using my number by accident and told me to contact my phone provider Completely useless Came here and saw an email to contact support The email isnt even in use Went online to try and contact customer support and Theres no way to do that They want you to sign up and use the app Ill never utilize uber services because of this Fix yourselves,1
304,I just noticed that on my recipients shows Ive been getting charged 5 dollars or more for tolls I only go through 1 toll for $175 So why am I being charged triple the price Thats past outrageous I dont for see me using Uber ever again  All December now January taking extra funds Also was charged waiting trip charges  I will for now on be using Lyft,1
305,I think Im going to talk to an attorney about my legal options and class action for your pricing scams If I plan a ride in advance you add a $1450 upcharge that you dont explain to a ride that wouldnt even be available if ordered less than two hours in advance Whats even the point Its also like this when rides would normally be available The point of scheduling the ride is to guarantee a ride Youre milking people for needing to get a request in before everyone is offline,1
306,They charge toll fees when you never take tolls They also sometime charge you for rides that werent taken,3
307,I am a regular customer with Uber I spend several hundred dollars a month on rides I have been up charged on at least three other occasions and just let it go because it is very hard to get in touch with anyone at your company but today I had an issue and I need someone to get back in touch with me and not ignore me or disregard my message I have tried contacting you through ubereats your customer support line and looked online for a phone number only to find out you dont have one,1
308,Always inaccurate while the ride can be good the app has had tons of issues in the States When traveling abroad its more accurate Driver hasnt moved in ages,2
309,The rates are not fixed and very problematic after the ride Not usefull service to avail,1
310,Keep sending Me Too Many alerts and notices when a car is in my area When I need it thats when I need it I dont need to know if its a car in my area,2
311,The customer service is terrible Over an hour ago I asked for help in the app because of an error with putting cash on the Uber wallet No response then I am forced to tweet and then I am told to DM them I did that They ultimately tell me to make a resquest for assistance online and sent me a link which is exactly the same as the support request they wont reply to In the DMs I requested assistance in English and they still spoke to me in Spanish,1
312,Its awful Absolutely worthless No customer service what so ever It NEVER knows my location correctly Can not accurately tell me when my driver will arrive and doesnt work correctly,1
313,Ive always had good experiences with Uber (not so much Uber eats) and I would rate five stars but I used 1000 of my points for a food order and then the restaurant cancelled the order and I was out that 1000 points I messaged them about it and never heard anything back and since Uber eats and Uber are the same company and Ive already left a bad review on Uber eats because they have already screwed me once before pretty good I had to leave this review on Uber Smh,1
314,The map is somewhat inaccurate as well as the fact that every time I need to book a ride I need to have a piece of identification to use The app as it needs to verify my identity every time this has never happened before so I hope it gets fixed pretty soon,3
315,Extremely disappointed Ive been an Uber platinum rider for years yet with that reward distinction they claim that you receive priority support FLAT OUT LIES The app offers absolutely NO way to reach out to support at all All their help tab does is run you around So I spent thousands to earn platinum status since it supposedly offered a priority support only to be let down and see that theres zero difference between any of the levels except them increasing the price of the rewards ,1
316,Working customer service is always taught me to be a little more lenient when it comes to issues of using any kind of service but the experience Ive had with the Uber app for the past 3 days have been by far the worst app experience Ive ever had in my life lets just start off with the fact that out of the blue the app would refuse to take any of my payment methods directly meaning that the only way I could have requested any kind of ride service from Uber with either through Google pay or Pay,2
317,This app works well enough but is not good when scheduling rides If you know you need a ride for a certain time you try to plan according to a certain schedule Numerous times Ive ordered a ride for 7:45 only to have a rider arrive early and leave because Im not ready 10 minutes in advance OR theyll arrive at 7:55 which is more acceptable as it is between that 10 minute window but still not ideal Please make this more accurate uber it makes it very hard to want to use your app,3
318,Schedule a trip feature should have a warning that the trip/booking is not guaranteed I scheduled a trip for early next morning to catch a ferry but when the scheduled time came there were no drivers available I could have easily missed the ferry I even received an email that the booking was confirmed Very misleading There needs to be a warning when you are scheduling a trip that its not guaranteed,1
319,There is a massive problem with the app I was waiting for the driver and when the driver arrived I wanted to move the map a little to see their location and then BAM With no messages saying are you sure you want to change your driver the app decided that thats not my driver anymore and called someone else instead I just saw the poor guy do a 180 and leave after getting all the way there and now I had to wait till someone else arrived At least dont change driver with a simple swipe,1
320,The worst cab booking app ever It shows one price before the trip and charges another afterwards Some drivers dont even bother to show that they have been and we have to suffer because of them You dont come to know about until months go by Do not use these fraud services You will regret it Even customer support doesnt follow up with you Better use Ola or other services than these fraudsters I really i wish i could put zero stars Thats how terrible they are,1
321,You guys charge passengers when they cancel their trip at the end moment Agreed and I have paid that When I book a cab the cab driver calls and confirms the drop location and they canacel it This has happen multiple times and I have to wait for many times before my trip starts I will have minimum of 4 to 5 cancellations and that affects passengers time On top of it there is customer care number to raise a complaint,1
322,It seems we have come far from the heady days where an Uber could be relied on In my area at least the driver who is 2 minutes away takes 10 minutes to leave home or wherever it is that he is camping Only for the trip to get cancelled I am gently writing this review while waiting for my 5th driver (not exaggerating) secure in the knowledge that I have plenty of time to write check my mail perhaps pen a short novella  before I am able to get a ride Ok 6th driver now   ,3
323,Password reset email expired before delivery Ive been trying to gain access to my account for hours The password reset requires a code via SMS (arrives instantly) then a code via email  which takes so long to arrive that the app times out I tried requesting a reset through the website and the same thing happens  by the time the email comes through the reset link in the email has expired Absolutely useless Ill just hail a cab,1
324,Your maps are not accurate and if the driver I had hadnt of stopped after seeing me walking and was willing to drop me off at the right location I would be asking for a refund as I named the business I was going to and made sure the street name was correct Please fix this as this is not the first time I have had problems with this location,1
325,The rating system is absolute garbage It should either be a 1 star or a 5 star review Anything less than 5 stars should automatically prompt the user to give justification for that rating That feed back should in turn then be shared with the driver/ passenger Also the rating system should have a reset period after a certain amount of time This is coming from a user that has a 498 rating,1
326,Toll routes  this app will give you an estimate price for your ride but wont ask you whether or not you would like to take a toll route If you do take the toll route (usually unexpectedly) you will be charged more with the same estimated drop off time If you dont take the toll route the estimated time changes but you keep the estimated price Too confusing for your drivers and riders Needs a fix Maybe a simple yes or no question before booking rides,3
327,I have been using Uber for years It used to be my go to app but it has definitely gone downhill The wait time is RIDICULOUS lately I have been waiting up to 30 minutes for it to connect only to tell me their are no drivers available They also need to screen their drivers better I have had drivers cancel on me minutes before getting to me as well as lodged safety issues that I have never been contacted on Definitely not the app it used to be :(,2
328,They take forever to accept a ride recently They take our money even before accepting a ride and dont refund all the time if you cancel and try agaain And when they accept sometimes they cancel on us just a few minutes away it makes us late for work and other things as well They need to improve services and Payment as well,5
329,The service is very unsatisfactory More often than not the preplanned route to pick you up will be ridiculous like entering a deadend and coming out of it or being recalculated multiple times partway through lengthening the wait This leads to unjustifiable delays in pickups and customer services accepts no accountability or liability for it Often youll also have to retry your booking multiple times because they double prices in a system that is out of touch with the cost of living,1
330,Ok once in a while but not often worth the frustration Have been late for work because drivers whod previously accepted had cancelled on me The rating system is flawed and kinda messed up Theres nowhere that Ive found that you can declare that you have trouble speaking  for example Without that drivers generally take it badly and think youre being off with them Rating slides and it gets harder to be picked up You vcan be perfectly polite + tips dont often help :( Wasted ££,2
331,Over last few months the service has been beyond pathetic Instead of coming to the pick up point drivers keep asking for the drop location if the payment is in cash etc And they end up cancelling the booking I almost missed my train once because of this Uber time to get your issues sorted out with the drivers The user experience of the service has become pathetic,1
332,I have lost track of the amount of times I have requested a taxi both today and in the past where they clearly cancel a request as they wait for the prices to go up I spent 20 minutes tonight trying to get a taxi due to an injury (yes it was a short journey) for all of the local (ish) taxis to decline it despite not moving at all during all 4 of my requests,1
333,Uber used to be great Recently its just awful Drivers cancelling constantly Drivers going the wrong way missing turns Drivers driving right past you Doesnt always correctly identify your pick up location App tries to let you know how long until the uber arrives make sure you always double it as its constantly wrong Surge pricing Cant believe I am saying this but going back to cabs and public transport,1
334,Barely any drivers available in my city and its the capital of our province I scheduled a ride 30 minutes in advance and the app suggets that a driver was found I come back to see where my driver is and Uber tells me that no drivers are available I schedule another pick up right away Uber somehow can somehow find a driver (but cant really) and when I cancel it Uber tells me that they are sorry for the delay but a driver should be available within the next 10 minutes,1
335,The app is not all that good  Every time I book the autorickshaw or the cab they literally cancel it and this is not only happens once this is happening evry time when I tried to book the ride if they dont want to go for ride then why they accept the ride and after 4 to t min they cancel it please uber solve this measure issue overall the app is best for the ride I have seen only one issue in this app thats it I request to uber vompany can you just bring the bike rides also ,2
336,Would give no stars I chose uber because it is supposed to be more efficient than taxi services I have to ready at least a half earlier than my shift start time in order to get an ride to work to be at work on time This morning I ended up cancelling the search for an uber after 20+ minutes of searching So many unreliable drivers cancel the trips if it is not a big enough trip for them to make money off DO BETTER,1
337,App sucks cant even find a support phone number or email Some of the routes charge so much by giving longer routes: for ex to get to point A I would be charged $1516 But to get to point B on the same exact route they take a longer route and charge $1718 for no reason when it shouldve been less than the first trip,1
338,Pathetic experience today There are lot of problems with the app and service 1 App notifies driver which are far far away 2 Estimated time of arrival is always wrong When it says 10 min It goes to 20 min Its always double considering distance traffic I am not sure how bad is algorithm 3 Most of the time driver cancels trip after sometime or denies if payment is non cash In that case there should be policy of negative points for driver 4 Sometimes unnecessary complex routes are shown,1
339,Loaded the app and info from previous use showed up Tried to load gift card with no luck on app Loaded online fine then showed up in app Deleted app  reloaded and now no personal info shows up And all payment info is gone Try to view gift card details and doesnt even give that option now And off course there is no way to reach out and ask questions Ill just take a cab A lot less hassle,1
340,You charge the passangers for cancelling their rideagreed but what if the driver accepts your ridecome to the pickup place you get into the autodriver confirms the dropoff location and asks you to get off his auto and asks you to cancel the ride Furthermore youre charged cancellation fees Moreover theres no customer care number to raise my complaint and of course no response on emails disappointed,1
341,If I made uber drivers wait the way I end up having to wait I would have to pay a fee Drivers constantly dont move anywhere you end up waiting 15 30 minutes for rides where youre told to wait 3 minutes The whole point of uber is to be convenient We would just take the bus if it was going to take as long,2
342,The service is extremely unprofessional Its impossible to get in touch with anyone in customer service to resolve an issue I am trying to log a complaint but absolutely no options on the app or uber help to do so and no customer care number I will be logging a complaint in consumer court about this,1
343,One of the worst mapping interface The navigation and mapping services is lower than the current industrial standards The saved places on the map dont show up properly and the location always jumps off to a next lane or two Given the status and scale of the company it is very saddening to experience this low grade service The in app experience and the navigation and mapping interface need a major overhaul,1
344,No more drivers Takes A LOT of time to find a driver and its always 20+ minutes of waiting WHEN you found one It can take 25 minutes to find one so good luck arriving at your destination within the hour Theres just NO MORE Drivers You gotta do something guys Updates the incentives pay them better I dont know But damn,1
345,Im rating 1star because of the issues booking vehicles  when very much required and urgent Uber ride will never confirm else after accepting a ride drivers will cancel the ride and we will never get confirmation again after 15 to 20 mins also we book the vehicles when its is required if we dont get the ride confirmation I dont understand the purpose of the online booking or going for traditional way of booking ,1
346,I prebooked cab for airport the before day Booking was not confirmed till next day and I again tries booking the cab but drivers canceled my trip and finally I missed day flight and had to pay for my next flight with family This is due to Ubers prebooking service Its better to remove that service when no driver is ready to accept the prebooking appointment for the customersCustomers are having a blind belief that the cab is already scheduled and will arrive at the exact time,1
347,They have the strangest logic You can schedule a ride and the driver gets to be 10 20 or even 30 minutes later than your scheduled time and you get no compensation (and it happens more often than not where Uber is late) but if you make a driver wait for 5 minutes they can cancel and charge you for it because its an inconvenience to them Not that I dont disagree with compensating the drivers but compensate the riders too if you cant uphold a scheduled ride,3
348,Bolt is much better and cheaper Uber also charged me £149 for a £60 trip and then refused to give me a refund because I didnt reply to one of their emails for 30 days (asking for duplicate information for the complaint form I filled out within 24 of the incorrect charge) Just dont do it to yourself,2
349,For months every time I open the app and request a ride it takes forever to find a driver (irrespective of location and on various devices) The app then often crashes or gets stuck The prices have also risen dramatically and when we do finally get hold of a driver are eventually charged even higher than first stated Raising pricer way over 100150% during busy periods is also pure greed Might as well take a taxi as at least they arrive immediately,1
350,If your driver takes a wrong turn Your prices goes up 25% Which doesnt only make the router longer and also the price The price doesnt update until your trip ends basically you have no idea that your price has gone up by alot until your trip ends And when you complaint for a refund you get a limited time Uber cash (amount of extra money you paid) that is used only for the tipping of the driver but not for a discount of extra money I paid for the trip,2
351,The most frustrating and disapointing update imaginable App now glitches EVERY TIME and will only show map and personal profile You have to REINSTALL in order to use the ride function Come on guys I want to rely on this service but cant because of its instability Will take my mornig commute back to the taxi services,1
352,If I have to review the app in terms of usage and experiencing rides then I would say that its been pretty good However I have one issue which I think the Uber Team really need to address Whenever I go into Payments Section apart from Cash no other saved payment options are shown such as Credit/Debit Cards UPI etc most of the times When I try to Sign Out from the app and then sign in either the saved payment methods would reflect or not Uber Team please look into this,3
353,Worst app I have ever use It never show correct estimated fareFare increases irregularly in between the trip without any reasonThe customer care service is the worst service they can provideEvery time I have used this app we always come up with issues In future we will never ever use Uber again and we will not promote Uber app through any mean,1
354,Usually I take uber as it is cheaper However recently the quality had dropped a lot Taxi drivers cancel the rides just when they are next to you Just because they found a better deal Hard to find an uber Sometimes impossible And the prices keep going up Unfortunately not the best app anymore,3
355,I like this app i always use it but its supposed to be more convinient than any other transport If theres no other drivers the price is getting higher which is fine if the drivers were great And i have met some of them But others are just plain rude i was so exhausted from work i booked an uber and i waited for 5 mins When he came to where i am he slowed down a bit IN FRONT of me then went straight out from where i am then cancelled didnt even messaged me or something RUDE,4
356,It keeps refusing the payment with my card I have to try a few times (with the same card) for the payment to go through The transaction never hits the bank I usually receive notification for failed attempts and in this case it never happens,1
357,Driver cancelling more time no drivers available most of the timesand also demanding extra money complained about the issues many times but no response given showing one price while bookingand another price while drop eventhough dropped within expected time drivers cancelling the travel and also demanding extra amount to continue most of the timevery worst experience cant even want to give 1 star also,1
358,The two stars were only because the App was working very good until the day I reviewed this I booked a cab and it showed that the driver accepted my request but the driver said he was unable to start the trip due to app issues So I had to book a second one and he reached the location but when he tried to start the trip by typing the PIN the trip was not starting even after several attempts I was lucky to not pay cancel fees but I request Uber to rectify their app related issues,2
359,Please you need to add options so someone can reach the driver directly when you forgot or lost an item in ride so that the car check for the item before picking up another rider and please add a direct customer call line to report a problem with a ride instead of just this few options on the app right now,3
360,I use taxis again now Uber drivers cancel all the time with no penalty from Uber Then when you go to rebook the price has gone up significantly because its now busy Of course you now pay 3 times more even though you were booked and they cancelled on you I started calling taxis again and found they are cheaper AND faster to get to me AND more reliable Thanks for making the taxi industry get their act together because now they are better than Uber,1
361,Using the app in the beginning was all good but the uber moto service is not so goodmost of the time driver asks for more than mentioned charge many times they say coming and cancel the ride sometimes the driver is not responding to calls and ultimately ride gets cancelled and i am asked to pay for the cancelled ride ,2
362,Getting trips is easy and convenient and the drivers in my experience are often excellent so this is just about the app The app is good for getting and monitoring trips but for anything else its useless You try and get a receipt and it says no receipt available You go to Get Trip Help or Find Lost Item and you just get a blank screen Messages like X is not available  check your connection are not helpful if my internet connection is fine Please improve,3
363,I faced a lot of problems recently The drivers are denying and you have to cancel and ofcourse youll pay the cancellation charges They are asking whether you are paying online or cash If you are paying online then they wont accept the call If you are paying cash then theyll ask double as they are using diesel engine and blah blah,1
364,UK needed to get home late at night waited 10 minutes for a driver who cancelled at the last minute and when I tried to get another was unable to for well over an hour despite seeing many drive by Eventually gave up and looked up the local taxi service The app is also very buggy ordered food but couldnt view the order because there was a tips for successful delivery pop up that wouldnt close Often experience similar glitches,1
365,I thought that scheduling rides in advance was a great idea until I was having some difficulty with my phone scheduling a ride less than 30 seconds in the past Then I couldnt easily just say Just schedule it NOW This caused me not to be able to schedule the ride at all making me late for work  🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬,2
366,It was worst experience I booked a cab for the first time and they showed some estimate price better than other apps so I Booked Uber but when I reached my destination the price was 40% higher than the estimate price However we reached on time When I checked the receipt they deducted booking charges i mean how does that I will prefer any other app but not Uber They didnt even refund and they also stated that I should take care for the next time,1
367,This uber app is getting worse day by dayI dont know why the prices are showing very high 2 weeks before we used to pay around ₹140150 for a specific location and now we have to pay its double amount  Sometimes I think of uninstalling it Its better to take a taxi out there its way cheaper than uber cars nowdays,1
368,In ad alone theyre showing instant cab but in real it takes more than an hour to get a cab Nowadays some drivers also started making troubles They used to call before the pickup and they are asking if you give me extra amount only we will come otherwise well call off your tripMost of the drivers not accepting online mode payment Price showed in app and at drop point are not same even while traveling in same direction in empty road without any toll booth Prices getting hiked at drop point,2
369,No option to choose my own route automatically charges for the fastest route in terms of time (via the motorway) even though this may cost more The driver however can then choose to go via normal streets which is less distance and should be cheaper but I still get charged the motorway distance Didnt used to be like this I now use ZCars my local companies app,2
370,Service in turkey is more than terrible if you are used to use bank cards as your main payment Other issues with cash too card payments you will suffer from refund issues extra charges issues double charges issues I have to contact support few times a week to fix a problem We have enough headaches already if Uber couldnt manage to resolve these issues then it not better than just taking a taxi from the street like anyone else So frustrating,1
371,Uber have no any coustomer complaint number As the driver delays my ride More than 30min to reach at pickup location Uber ride takes charges for cancellation and this is not correct If a driver is not near by to take up the ride as soon as possible then why uber doesnt change the driver by their side Why should I cancel my ride and pay for next ride,1
372,Customer service none  All I required was to enable the account (Unsure why it was disabled) Email upon email asking to verify mobile no: Sent proof of monthly bill as requested Then asked to reset email address associated with that number No idea what that is as I have never used Uber) Same email over and over again asking to reset it I cant reset what I dont know I do know my phone number and I do know my email address Clearly thats too comlicated for you,1
373,Drivers just keep on cancelling the rides a number of times after knowing the destination Its helpful sometimes though the service provided is good enough but repeated cancelations by the drivers are disturbing Even the passenger is charged extra on the next ride if the trip is canceled by the driver itself and that is not really acceptable,3
374,The policy that allows drivers to cancel trip has been a major inconvenience They cancel trips based on the most trivial issues like if they cant identify locations Basically uber seems to be more focused on driver satisfaction than that of the customers,2
375,I didnt think Ill be giving a single star rating to uber because I would always prefer uber rides than others My sister and I have experienced the same issue I paid the amount to driver through Phonepay but its showing unpaid I contacted uber support it said you must contact the driver bcz its problem from his side I contacted him but he is not responding Does uber dont have local managers to look upon Its been a week now I contacted uber and driverno response Should I file a case,1
376,Finally succumbed to joining Uber but concerned about the cancellation policy mentioned in some reviews Checked legal before installing and found policy is not there but is on a link which is broken so could not view Got a sign up email with Terms  Conditions but cancellation policy link was missing completely Doesnt give much faith in the service,1
377,I am not happy with service because at the time of booking its showing me Rs 343 only and after the complet my trip the price has been changed its charge Rs  903 Its not a way to work make the passengers stupid its so wast and bad experience with the uber And after I raised my Complaint till now they didnt reply me I am so much disappointed with the service its so much bad experience ,1
378,Bad very bad experience These cabs services are getting horrible day by day every time cab driver ask where we want to go else they cancel it sometimes they dont even cancel and we have to pay the charges as they are earning money user experience is getting worse day by day I got late many times because of this experience had to book cab 3 times and had to wait approximately 30 minutes for the cab No customer satisfaction from this so called world best cab services,1
379,The last few months the service is very bad No one is accepting the ride In an emergency its very difficult to get an auto or cab Very disappointed Must wait ateast for half an hour for a ride even if they accept it and when we wait for them at the last minute they cancel it,1
380,It would make so much more sense if it wasnt just searching for empty Ubers but also looking if any are arriving to your destination before the emptyone can be there For some reason it finds a car in another neighbourhood instead of the 5 cards arriving before Sometimes even the bus is faster when it chooses cars so far away and I just had an Uber pick me up after the listed dropoff rime,3
381,Works for the most part but certain trips at certain times from certain places just dont get any drivers despite there being serveral nearby Last time I used it the fare said £16 so I confirmed only to be told theres no drivers went back on and it was £22 again no drivers Tried a third time and didnt notice the price only to later realise that original £16 fare was now £42 and you can bet they found a driver for that one,3
382,For the last 56 times on your app you guys have made sure to assign a duplicate charge every single time I have to go to the help section every time to dispute which takes around 510 mins By that time I have already booked a nonUber cab The type of service that your app provides continues to plunge almost on a monthly basis,1
383,I dont know if anyone of you are facing this issue  but in my area  which is central Kolkata Uber drivers especially moto drivers are charging extra money irrespective the fare shown  They always call to know the drop off location and cancels it  Instead of coming to the location they do all such nuisance  Last day there was an emergency and i felt helpless  Uber should look into the matter and take an action ,1
384,The service is incredibly pathetic Drivers cancel trip everytime They refuse to take the trip and fortunately if they agree to take the trip they claim extra charges And the worst part is I complained a few times but got no response I took package delivery service from uber and guess what here too the driver or the delivery man has demanded extra charges,1
385,Worst app and service ever DELETED AGAIN Completely dysfunctional pathetic GPS (3km fault) waited 31 minutes for car that was first shown as 14 minutes away extremely slow to respond 45 minutes  at OR Tambo  Chief Dawid Stuurman airports takes complete control of ones credit card details Private shuttles are so much easier and trustworthy,1
386,Useless app you might as well just walk to your destination AT LEAST two drivers cancel your trip before one accepts it When they accept they just dont move for 5 minutes before actually starting the car Its basically just a gamble whether you will be on time at your destination or not Furthermore the app never updates streets under construction and drivers constantly take the wrong route because they dont know they cant access certain areas which have been closed 6 MONTHS AGO,1
387,Bad Driver Experience Regularly  The drivers keep asking where to go and then keep cancelling Suggestion: Incorporate the location in the app so that they can decide whether to accept the ride or not Please look into this at the earliest because it has been causing significant amount of inconvenience,1
388,The convenience of hailing a ride guys Lately it proves very difficult to get rides in the morning The drivers accept rides and after 8 minutes they just cancel and Uber still charges you This will happen multiple times in a single morning until I have to make alternative transport arrangements which takes away the convenience mentioned in my first line above I hate the admin of asking for a refund for driver cancelled trips  FIX THIS UBER,1
389,Worst app You book  then the driver calls and asks where are you going  If it is suitable for him  he will cancel For a 2 km ride it takes half an hour to book Moreover the app will again and again ask to pay cancellation fees to the next driver when it is the drivers who cancel Worst experience everytime,1
390,Services are getting terrible day to day Drivers enquire the drop location and then cancel if its not feasible for them We are completely at the mercy of drivers Also no proper customer complaint interface available Uber please monitor and control activities of your drivers Or else you will start losing market Hate to say this but yellow taxi services are far better As it is drivers dont turn on the AC,1
391,Hello I really want this to be watched and taken in consideration Ive been using the lime app for scooters for almost 1 year since I have changed to uber I like uber that does not take money from unlocking but theres a serious problem about ending the ride I stayed almost 5 minutes taking more money then needed I have money to pay but this is not legal to have a system failure that is not fixed and to take more money from the people,1
392,Charges extra after trip completion Not sure if anyone else faced the same issue but the amount that I book and the actually fare after trip completion is totally different I even spoke to Uber executive on call about this issue their reply was please try reinstalling the app I dont think Ill install the app after uninstalling it Use Ola forget Uber said the driver himself XD,1
393,Uber have no control over drivers Almost most of the drivers cancelled ride after listening where to to go Uber have no control over these things Its very time wasting job to book a cab from uber Few days back i booked cab after waiting 15 minutes for cab when cab about to reach in 3 minutes suddenly driver cancelled the ride and tranferred called to another driver than again ride waiting time was 18 minutes Its very very annoying Atleast uber should take step on this type serices,1
394,Ive been struggling to connect with Uber lately Most drivers are not accepting my trips It seems as though Uber no long serves their drivers This results in very difficult drivers who dont take trips unless they are long ones It is incredibly frustrating,2
395,I had worst experience about this app Most of the time drive cancles the trip If we have to reach on time or want to catch a train or flight than its not helpfull for uhhh Also there is no options for complaints about our issues There is also no replies or support from uber customer care I dont suggest this app to anyone Very disaapointing frequent cancellation in our urgency,1
396,Uber put me to pay because I canceled 2 trips In the first request Uber was stuck few minutes and I have to cancel Second request Uber added time from 7 min to 11 min I canceled this trip too I was in a hurry and I switched to Bolt In 3 min I was in the car heading to destination Sorry Uber you cant take my money for this I uninstalled app I will use Bolt from now on,1
397,Cant pay tried 2 debit cards that I use daily refused Cash payment limited at 20$ Useless for me Usually I just delet but here because of the registration process and the personal datas that I had to give I had to let a review Also no help but a FAQ And spams in my mailbox,1
398,Worthless app With doesnt care about customer service When we try to call the driver he disconnects for a long and then he say cancel the trip and rebook But I could see the shows him in the next Street  Even thought it is the drivers fault I had to cancel and rebook they still charged me 115 for cancellation Cheating people,1
399,It is a very useless app you have to wait for 1 hour you will keep doing it in emergency but the cab will not come the Uber driver calls and asks for the location then says we cant go and dont even cancel the ride,1
400,Today I booked the cab and after 5mins cad was ot moving from the location When I called and requested the drives he asked the drop location after refused to come and waited for 15min and disconnected Whom to report such issue Plz show the drop location to drivers to end such discomfort Plz open call center to hear our problems,1
401,It was still yesterday that I was simply happy with app but yesterday I was very frustrated as I was traveling with my old parents and I had booked n SUV XL and there was no vehicle showing and after trying for half an hour decided to break the journal and took an auto But after traveling for 10min first SUV driver calls and next SuV driver calls and 3rd SUV driver calls I requested them that I didnt get any vehicle But cancellation charges were made There was some problem,2
402,Its a nightmare to book a cab using your platform The drivers have no sense of respect for their passengers in terms of wasting their time by having them wait and canceling the cab at the last minute They have the odacity to call the customer and ask them to cancel Really disappointed ,1
403,Uber India really needs to update their mapping system Consistently when I book a ride it says 5 minutes til pickup but in reality it can take much longer maybe over 30mins real time wait Why dont Uber have a live map system that tracks real time traffic and road conditions Google already has this function So why are uber maps lacking this important function,2
404,My app after 80 rides all of a sudden it tells me oops something wrong and refuses to work However I downloaded a new one and now my trips are starting from 1 and my old account doesnt exist anymore and I ha e contacted the support department but to no avail i have had no response Its time to ride with their Comoetitor because they are tired of money I still havent succeeded in retrieving my uber app and cant use the same email to get back to my original,1
405,If the driver cancels the ride (he no longer wants to pick you up I guess) youre still charged the full amount Then its up to Uber to refund you which they wont  instead theyll just not claim the transaction leaving it pending for however many days the banks standard is (for example 16 for Revolut) Ive asked Uber repeatedly and they said they already rejected the transaction which is a lie Uber responded with a link that leads to an article on Big Boss 14 Salman Khan Wow,1
406,Cancellation are more than booking I have faced lots of problems in getting a cab Drive confirm the booking and cancel the same just after speaking about the dropping location I think uber should close its service to gurugram as no drive wants to go there Also if someone confirms the same ask for about 30 min to come Its a horrible service Its better person should hire auto if he or she needs can on urgent basis,1
407,Pathetic experience 2 says in a row 6 cab drivers cancelled on me after knowing the drop location I had been standing on the pickup location for 35 minutes waiting for the cab Above that they had an odacity of charging me with the cancellation fee when the driver cancelled on me This is rude and inconvenient Horrible,1
408,Drivers say they dont get compensated for driving to pickup locations Have had 3 drivers ask me to cancel the trip because they dont want to accept the trip I usually end up having to pay a cancellation fee despite the driver having never moved Extremely dissatisfied because this is not my fault nor the drivers (although this means drivers are somewhat lazy),2
409,Dont know whats wrong with the app Post installation Ive been asked to add the payment method to which I added my card and after authentication of one sample transaction payment method didnt add And also app is showing message to verify the email after adding that too it showed email already added For now app has been uninstalled as it was just consuming space nothing else,1
410,Very very worst experience with uber app I have selected cash as payment method after my trip ends I have paid my full amount at the end of the trip But still showing unpaid and I cant connect to customer care very worst customer support experience I have experienced and going to delete this app,1
411,Im the regular user of uber and I had a poor experience it will take lot of time to book a auto always drivers will not come to proper pick up location i need to walkin for them and always price will be charged more after drop then what is the use of showing estimated fare  It will be no use if I get that refund as a coupon that I can use it in next ride because it will happen Daily Mainly drivers will ask location how to go everytime pathetic Uber should look into all issues,2
412,Uber is the worst driver app I have ever come across There is no way we can contact the Uber helpline and no customer service is given Highly NOT recommended I have been struggling with an issue with an Uber driver and have wasted hours finding a contact number to communicate my issue with the Uber head office but am unable to find any contact number Highly unethical and unprofessional application Not recommended at all,1
413,I have never seen such a wrost app in my whole life Compare that app with Uber app to Ola and see where ₹18 is coming in Ola Here Uber app is charging you ₹ 38 Charges too much Its a very wrost app its on my phone and Im going to uninstall it The people above have completely disappointed me,1
414,Drivers are just passing my request one after the other like people didnt matter Wasted 30 minutes trying to find a driver four people skipped after accepting Uber should penalize drivers or limit their chance to just skip requests after accepting Its wasting a lot of time,1
415,Mostly bad two drivers cancelled on me after making wait for a long time the second one cancelled after he arrived Please review and check your drivers Some are good and timely though Please if the uber drivers wont drive they shouldnt accept the ride in the first place making us cancel and incur extra expenses,2
416,First ride itself is pathetic experience auto drivers are not ready if we choose online payment method they just need cash in hand if we dont have enough cash in hand they are cancelling the booking on the spot  asking to pay more than actual price which shown on app Though drivers are cancelling the booking still money is deducting from our wallets which leads to hectic prices  If drivers are not ready for online payment then there is no need to book using Uber can talk to regular autos,1
417,I was a loyal customer and I have used the app for years but recently it started getting impossible to get a ride I would request for a ride and even though there where a lote of drivers no one wanted to pick me up unless the distance was far I have a good uber rating but only long distances matters to uber drivers I will go back to using bolt Uber is unreliable,2
418,Third class app and services I booked an outstation cab but the booking was not shown in my upcoming trips It got cancelled automatically I tried to book again letter but every single time it is showing error even with multiple accounts same problem is there,1
419,Im just giving him one star bcoz Before the ride they show different charges and after complete the ride the application demand extra chargesand lots of times this have been happening with me I have paid extra charges and ryt now Im getting irritate of this things and sometimes Uber drivers cancel the rideso the ride of the charges add on my another ridethat I havent taken🤬🤬,1
420,Wont stop showing promotions after theyre turned off Im seeing a notification for Lunch delivered on demand Get food when you want it despite having notifications disabled for Promotions and Recommendations,1
421,When the driver actually arrives the journey is very pleasant but more often than not the driver cancels on me a couple minutes before the ride This is the third time theyve cancelled on me for a ride to the hospital making me scramble for an option to ot miss my appointment The support centre is absolutely useless Do better,1
422,Most unreliable service guaranteed 1 The driver cancels the trip without any reason after making you wait for a lot of timeThere is no support for this and also app will not show trips canceled by driverThey will only show trips canceled by you so that they can collect cancellation fee 2 The trip details will not show payment successful or paid anywhere even in receiptThey will only show it when the amount is pending Didnt want to waste my time writing a review but it was worst experience,1
423,Your drivers are abusing the system to artificially inflate the ridiculous dinamic charge coordinating through whatsapp to deny rides until it goes up This results in several times getting rejected to the point there are no more ubers around Put some kind of soft penalization already on this or blacklisted zones by drivers or the option for the driver to offer a counterdestination As a passenger its pretty stupid to wait for 15 minutes while also paying more after that ridiculous wait,1
424,Waste appTried booking an auto so many times and it was booked once which was 20 Mims away and I waited 30 minutes instead and the driver canceled the trip in the last momentwhen it showed 30 minutes I tried canceling it but then they were charging some amount for doing so I didntworst experience with this worst app,1
425,I am seriously disappointed with the trips I have made with Uber they are charging unnecessary hidden charges at the beginning trip starts with 600/ till you reach destination it reaches 1000/ how What the hell is surge/gst you are already including all the expenses and charging 600700 for a 32km trip then you additionally charge surge Surprising Theres no way to track such thing this is literally pathetic you are making life difficult to travel and trust upon Uber,1
426,Total waste of time and money with u I have booked uber car for 9:05 pm on 13/02/22 and it got booked successful I was waiting till 9:20 but no 1 contacted me nor cab came to my place I was supposed to catch bus from chiloda at 10 but due to careless approach and this attitude I was getting late and stuck in so many things Just hate ur service and ur co Understand the situation when someone is about to catch train Or bus and you guys taking it for granted Gaaliya dene ka mann kr ra he,1
427,Worst experience booked cab reached late at pickup point  as we had to go through peek hours where there was heavy traffic so driver changed the route  that route too was crowded  charges was increased  1st i was paying online but as we were very late  due to network issues at the destination I paid the driver in cash full amt  this incident is now 6 months old from 3 months i have sent multiple times complaint through app but no reply  on Google couldnt find customer care no too,1
428,Drivers keep on cancelling the rides irrespective of the pickup location or drop off location Now it takes almost 34 tries and 20+ minutes of minmum wait to finallybook a ride Give the users the option to rate the drivers right at the moment when they cancel the ride,1
429,Lovely for food Too easy for people to get alcohol from this app Alcohol dependant roommate frequently answers the door drunk and is still given more vodka There doesnt seem to be any sort of suspicion to the fact she orders it most days either And finally there is no option on the app to get alcohol orders blocked to certain addresses (Obviously should need proof that you live there so people dont abuse this power),3
430,App gets stuck in a loop Trying to book at LAX Select a ride and try to confirm location get a pop up explaining where the pick up is Click back and it goes back to the select a ride screen Gave up and got a taxi,1
431,The App itself is great But if you ever need to contact Uber help or support for a theft or a safety issue then you simply cant Driver stole my phone  its shown on tracing software There is no phone number currently for riders Its a disgrace,1
432,In romania the service has become worse over the last 34 years cars with no seat belts drivers who wait for you to cancel or cancel themselves because they consider the trip too short drivers who drive dangerously (in cars with no seat belts obviously) etc All messages to support recieve answers such as were sorry you had a bad experience At least the app works decently,2
433,Charged me double the initial amount There was no changing of route or traffic it was a simple trip of 1520 minutes Edit: I contacted Uber customer support and was able to solve this isuue Updated the rating here Thank you,1
434,Absolutely disgusting experience I had to take my baby to hospital but every driver was canceling after hearing the location I had to take local transport to the hospital If I cant find service in time of emergency then whats the use of this service My destination wasnt in the next road that they can give any excuse for location being close It used to be good but seems like a local rickshaw service now,1
435,The most useless app ever the wait for a driver is ridiculous 90% of the time theres no cars available or no drivers available by far THE WORST transportation app I do not recommend the download at all better off using taxify or bolt Uber has really disappointed its users,1
436,Each time you look for a ride its Dynamic fare calculation system increases fare of same destinations by around 10% Above mentioned feedback is based on at more than ten instances Being same experience repeatedly user will for sure switch to better service provider,1
437,The worst riding app Customer Support Service is present just for name sake We cannot contact through call or even chat only mail system is available Better go to Ola or rapido who solve any issue instantly unlike Uber who take 23 days to understand the issue through mail,1
438,Horrible service I canceled twice and had the same person take my ride I had to wait more than 30 minutes and then the driver just went away without canceling or even answering my calls or texts,1
439,I cant log in I only receive the message Request failed Unable to process this request at the moment please try again later Ive already uninstalled the app restarted the phone and tried to log in on a different phone I contacted the support and they said my account is ok So Ill use another app,1
440,There appears to be a trend developing which is bordering on a scam Uber drivers purposely not heading towards passengers when booked via the app hoping that the passenger will eventually cancel out of impatience and incur a $20 cancellation charge There are even some cases where drivers are somehow able to accept trips that are thousands of miles away again hoping the customer will cancel and getting a cancellation fee,1
441,As a long time user I am quitting Uber The drivers in Melbourne have rigged the system so they focus on getting cancellation fees rather than driving people around So many times Ive had rides cancelled including pre booked rides The galling thing is the drivers blame me for the cancellation There is no customer service and the drivers are simply driven by perverse incentives Its a disgusting system when you think about it Im going to use my car more now and at a push use taxis,1
442,Not good for ride It takes huge money All car are very old model and car space is also too small Overall if you book uber you have to know that you are paying huge money for a old small car You can use taxi for more comfort at low cost There are no rules in their policy because some time drivers cancel our booking request and asking for huge payment when you are in critical situation,2
443,I used this app for many days but I faced a bitter experience yesterday  whenever I booked a cab after sometime driver asked the destination and canceled the ride After wasting so much time I canceled the third you provide and you said you will be charged for this why Please solve this kind of issue,1
444,The first frustrating thing is rides are automatically booked I dont know why Drivers call me they say that i have booked a ride but i havent booked what the hell i think this app has many bugs in it I just dont know what is uber doing the better way to ride is ola But uber is best because It allows more than 2 persons for riding but ola only allows 2 Please fix this issue then you will be the greatest service provider for riding ever,1
445,Whenever I try to book a ride either it takes alot of time or driver accepts the request and after making me wait for long they just reject it So if someone is in emergency or getting late then it is useless app They just waste my time I would rather prefer to book a ride personally over booking through uber,1
446,Very disappointed with Ubers service these days It takes forever to book a ride and the drivers cancel a lot these days  especially during peak hours Ive started using Bolt instead because its more consistent and far less frustrating Uber you need to up the quality of your service,2
447,No option to give ratings for drivers who cancel the ride on their own without informing No option to buy ride pass other than Paytm and payment via paytm is not accepted for some reason No way to complain about anything Not at all customer friendly app Edit: Its Feb 2022 and still no way to rate drivers who cancel the ride after assuring to reach pick up point No way to track when drivers cancel the ride I want to rate 1 star for such drivers,1
448,Orderered an Uber only connected me to ones 15+ minutes away and then gives the driver a route which will take another 10 minutes to get to my destination when it couldve only taken 3 Very lucky this wasnt somewhere completely important I needed to be on time,1
449,Uber is so bad Took a trip and whilst driving the trip did not want to continue and kept asking the driver for a pin Have no idea why theyre using this system and its giving so much problem I mean the driver dropped me of just there I feared for my life as people were approaching me making jokes about robbing me This was near taxi ranks but I had no cash on me as the app is linked to my card Uber puts lives in danger Best avoid it if possible,1
450,This is the worst app ever Everytime the drivers ask the drop point and payment mode then they cut the call and cancel the ride I dont even want to give one star to this worst app I wasted my 40mins because of this app I almost missed my bus because of this so called app uber Ill not suggest this app to anyone Wheneve its urgency they cancel the rides Its unworthy and horrible,1
451,Uber has been a reliable source of travelling for me since a long time Recently since few weeks the service is horrible Drivers just cancel the trips Is the driver not aware before hand where the trip is for This is highly unprofessional to just cancel trip as per their wish Need to cancel min 56 rides to get one and sometimes that also doesnt happen,1
452,If there was an option of giving zero star then i would have given that Why the hell is your map not updated It shows every possible closed roads and because of that we suffer Its the main thing you should keep updated and I dont think the customer has to tell you that,1
453,Terrible I tried to schedule a ride for 7:00 the next morning to go to the hospital they charged my credit card 2 times and theres no way to see if someone has confirmed the ride and no way to cancel Theres not even a customer service number to call to see if I can get a refund,1
454,This app has turned horrible if its a cheap ride they will just cancel it and not just one driver There money greedy and dont care about ppl needing a lift I dont drive but it isnt a far ride I have to start calling ubers half an hour before I get to work because they all just cancel continually a few of them have made me late for work No consumer service what so ever and they make u cancel so they can charge u a fee I am over this app and no longer going to use it I will call a cab,1
455,All the time deives are not welling to go with online payment modeAnd also most pathetic issue is before coming to your door step always drivers askws for destination and if its not their convenience location they can cancel the trip saying nothing Request your team to check this issue and chnage your company cab driver behaviour issue and company customer policy to make a hassle free tripThese cases are increasing day by day,1
456,Useless app Always charge extra amount Map route is always loger than real Driver only follow map never listen customer Every time same experience Customer care service agent never registered complainNot helpful No follow up issue Driver always charge an extra amount Why dont follow customers routes rather google map loger route,1
457,Worst experience do not take this ride i have booked same location all time the same driver connect and after seeing where i have to go he just cancel the booking 3 times this happens in just few min ago I recomment do not visit via uber  If you want to improve your service then remove cancel trip frm auto drivers app,1
458,Sick and tired of drivers cancelling the rides almost missed my flight because of this Uber should do something about this and fix it asap otherwise you are going to lose customers Very unreliable drivers and service,1
459,It was a bad experience The app shows the longest way to reach the destination And theyve raised the trip fare upon reaching Very disappointes with the service,1
460,Poor experience in Thalwil Switzerland After the app trying 45 times to get a different price than the originally quoted price the driver took off within 3mins of arrival and disappeared with no option to get our masks due to Covid not a great customer experience Must be fixed No option to rate rougue driver,1
461,Would give it a lower rating if i could I have not been able to get an uber in the last month using the cash payment option and i hardly get one with card payment if the driver does not cancel on me Customer service is useless in helping me and only giving me scripted answers I would not recommend anyone install the app for they will only be dissipointed,1
462,Uber is getting worst and worst day by day especially in comparison to Ola We got 9 cancellations in cab and 4 in ola auto The location was 3 km away from my location and even though there was premium to be charged no one agreed to take the ride 3000 satisfaction level Kudos Uber,1
463,When I booked a raid driver accepted it and he was 100 mt away from me And he went 5 km with another customer and didnt cancel the raid And even not answering my calls Same happened for next raid This time the drivers doesnt have an option of incoming call Then I tried to get Ubers Customer care number which is not even available One of the pathetic services by this people,1
464,App seems to be intentionally designed to make it impossible for complaints to be addressed Simplification of the interface has made it extremely difficult to raise genuine issues Uber also forces the vilification of the driver rather than own responsibility,2
465,My first trip was awesome and the second my request give me to sit a road for half an hour First problem caused by app they change vehicle two times cause time delay and second was by the driver that may contact two times and not get a positive and finally arrival time goes far away,1
466,Hate the app tried to register with user app and after registration added my debit card for payment but after registration for every thing it says oops something went wrong not able to book any ride not able to reset or delete my account and payment card which is registered now Im afraid for my card which is registered umer people should seriously spend on app development I still support the same as again it happened for a ride which I had was forced to pay in cash the app was not allowing,1
467,I mean why not close the service in Patna if you dont have any cabs available anytime Like horrible experience Everytime I think lets give it a try may be this time it will be better End up in just searching and ultimately book ola,1
468,Drivers are not accepting rides for long distance specially at the time of nightthey just need to complete their target no one care about customers jsut accepting and then cancelling rides after checking of its a long distance ride ola or uber drivers are same they just switch apps,1
469,Driver always charge extra on cash trip yesterday faced the same issue  day by day the experience with u er is getting horrible there are customer service available whe asking the refund the uber clearly says no as they dont refund the money I will never ever use uber in my life  deleting this app forever and switching to OLA  though the prices are high But they ask what they show Unlike uber they just know how to fraud with their customer,1
470,While booking the ride the fare showed to be ₹73 but when I reached at my destination it increased to ₹91 The sole reason behind choosing uber over other apps was the low fare but in the end I ended up paying more than it was in other apps Looks like I wont be making any trips with uber anymore,2
471,U schedule a ride at 10:45 to catch a train A nearby ride gets scheduled and just at 10:40 the driver cancel the ride and another ride gets autobooked which shows that it will take 25 min to arrive and at the end u will miss your train If u cancel the ride it will deduct ur charges Very cheap third class and Poor facilities I would give negative rating if that facility is provided by playstore for this app,1
472,Please dont use this app It is unsafe drivers will cancel your trip because they dont want to do short trips They will not be held accountable for it read other users reviews and you will see the same trend Clearly Uber as a company does not care because I have read several other reviews and the problems are common Do you care How will you resolve this Are you making an attempt to resolve it,1
473,Absolutely bad It gave you rides too far for you and the wait times are long Its a good app but internally its a completely shame how the algorithm works,1
474,Service used to be good but now it seems that drivers wont pick you up unless its a decent distance / fee Friends and I unable to get drivers many times even after they confirm the ride and then they just sit and dont move FRUSTRATING,2
475,I feel like is the last time I am using this service I sent a parcel to a customer today till now the customer has never received his order And the driver is not reachable And the customer service is almost useless They can do nothing urgently This is the second time I am having this bad experience I dont even mention how many time drivers cancelling rides,1
476,Terrible experience Prebook to the airport and driver cancels 5 mini AFTER he is due to pick up Nothing available App has no complaints or emergency contact Used to be great now complete rubbish,1
477,Worst service provider every time I book Uber Moto the drivers call and ask for the location and says that he will come and then doesnt show up or cancels the trip Such a waste of my time Absolute worst Rider made me wait for about 15 minutes didnt call or ask anything and then suddenly cancels then another rider calls and ask for my destination and says that he is coming and then cancels,1
478,Strongly disagree becareful I used Uber in Peru and it charges me when the driver is approaching before starting the ride then the driver stops approaching at the end the order appears canceled but the charge has already been made on my card,1
479,Used to be easy to get a ride arround 5:30 These days its shows drivers 7min away but there is no response In winter and when its raining it is difficult to walk then a uber used to be there but now it is challenging,3
480,Absolutely unreliable Drivers that are nearby refuse jobs meaning I either dont get a driver at all or I get one which is 5 miles away and will take 20 minutes to arrive This happens all the time now and its really frustrating when you need one ASAP,1
481,There should be a fee for drivers who cancel Or even an option to give them a rating I want to book an uber knowing Ill get to my event on time I dont want a driver to drive 10 minutes cancel and by the time I order again Im late,1
482,Is there any option to give less than 1star rating Such a bad app and worst company UBER Driver starts trip directly (without any pin or concern) No customer care (number) support at all Totally worst They charge full amount even if the trip is not started or driver dropped at the pick up location Customer care says we know that you were dropped at the pick up but cant refund any money Such a bad company Will never gonna use UBER again Tq for your worst services in India,1
483,So its still the same Charging over £10 for a 5 minute journey Not acceptable Your company is fraudulent and needs to be stopped You have absolutely no need to charge that much Im going back to regular cars because they price it fairly,1
484,Very very poor service Always driver will ask you for additional cash money else he will deny to pickup If you cancel the ride you will be charged a cancelation fee The worst part is there is no costumer service line at all,1
485,Now a day we book a cab and driver call us and ask for drop location and cancel the trip This is not a continuous problem Please remove that driver can cancel the trip Or put a chargers on cancellation if driver canceled then he need to pay Request you to make the policy to control this issue,1
486,Hello team The error faced while using the application is that the payment was done in cash and the driver ended the ride from his end but my application didnt show any option to complete the rideI have already made the payment but your application is not showing any option to complete the transaction Also one disappointment faced during the ride experience was that there is not a single helpline no to call,1
487,I am facing traveling fare related issues for past couple of days And there is no proper customer care service number or email id available for us I have paid extra for last few rides more than what showcase on app and after complain via app help option no acknowledgement from Uber,1
488,Good App but sometimes in case of emergency they will delay the timings They will accept your ride but keep on reasoning Ill be late Please fix this problem Thank you,3
489,Its a BS app the ride was not confirmed and I canceled because was taking too long to find a driver and this messed up app still charged me Its getting worst than DIDI one thing for sure I wont be using UBER as often as before,1
490,This is my experience in Kolkata not sure if its the same every where else Once I book a ride the driver accepts then I immediately calls me and rudely demands to know the destination and if he feels like it then he will come to my pickup albeit after 1015 minutes of dilly dallying Else he will just cancel willy nilly The cycle goes on to the next driver and the next Until finally one comes to the pickup and demands I cancel the uber trip and pay him cash or via upi Dismal,1
491,It has become worse over the few monthsDrivers are continuously cancelling bookings Look at this matter Drivers just ask for the drop location Only demands cash Why do not Uber look at this matter I lost my train just because of this issue,1
492,Worst app ever map was not showing the crt destination and after selecting the destination also it reloaded twice again I booked auto 2 times it got cancelled for no reason 3 time in map it showed the driver arrived but no one came I called the driver twice he did not pick the call after few minutes the auto was away from my pickup point again it got cancelled this is how this app works I wanted to go urgently but due to this app I wasted 30 minutes worst experience will never use this app again,1
493,Very much bad experience with uber Driver is always ask where to go and all rubbish things They even not comes 1 hour and 30 minutes drive is also not cancel the cab and then he cancel the cab another was on same things So uber has time value for driver but not client You know what is our time value I have rubbish screenshots of driver chat,1
494,Very pathetic service specially when you pick up it from railway station Driver would ask about your location n charges showed in app then he dined or transfer his trip n finally put mobile on airoplane mode so trip become outdated due to network issued created by drive Better to choose other options for trip N there is no any complaint option in appIndia need a trip app which work with honesty,1
495,Your map service is the worst Ive seen Shows new roads that does not exist and the route to a pick up or destination is like its a tourist bus Does not recognize the shortest route,1
496,The rides are fine What is not is the way they cheat on arrival times When u choose a ride the wait time shown is way shorter than the actual time Very rarely have the arrived at your pick up point within the time first shown A scam to keep our others in the same business,3
497,Now a days Uber is not helpful We have to wait for long time and most importantly when we cancel the ride they will charge some penalty and when their driver cancel the ride they will not pay us anything This is stupidity and shows that how much value they give to customers,1
498,Uber has to improve their system because they charge fine although some time their system is not working properly we have to wait for 30 to 40 minutes for drivers And sometimes driver denied after calling youplz improve your systemand dont charge fine,3
499,App just froze and I could not hail it wouldnt open anywhere for me to load a trip I wonder whats going on Had to use another ride sharing app to hail otherwise I would have been stranded,1
500,Terrible experience used to be a reliable services many times drivers dont want to pick up your trip because your trip just cost 10 dollar for 2 or 3 kilometers then you as a customer have to pay 30 dollars for the same 3 km the I order a food 90 minutes still not on the way charging me 23 for the whole orders terrible service and many others things,1
501,Uber service is becoming pathetic these days as everytime you book the ride drivers call and ask for the drop location and money showing on the app and then payment mode And finally after taking 510 minutes they cancel the ride and we need to bear the penalty for the same Sometimes driver start the trip and goes somewhat far and mentions the drop location in some miles and then they cancel the ride and we need to bear the charges Drivers should not cancel the ride,1
502,The app works fine but the drivers never turn up Without fail whenever I order an uber the driver cancels at least once And if they only cancel once consider yourself lucky because its usually several cancellations,3
503,Couldnt get an Uber due to an error with the app on Saturday night I reinstall it and updated my account still same error How can you make a service unusable I would have got a taxi if Uber didnt put them out of business,1
504,Useless Doesnt seem to be a time limit on how long a driver has to accept or reject You can easily wait 5m per driver just hoping one would accept Half an hour later youre still waiting Bolt is much better,1
505,It is noted that there seems to be a lot less drivers available lately On most days you struggle to have a driver accept your request and you wait very long Definitely causing inconvenience and additional stress arriving at your destination late,2
506,There is clearly a shortage of drivers It can take well over 20 minutes trying to find an Uber despite being in the main city However once an uber is found and doesnt cancel the trips themselves are good,3
507,Extremely terrible ride and bad customer service too they mentioned one rate while the booking moment and when we reached the destination the driver is demanding extra amount for the trip this is the horrible app which I have ever used,1
508,Pathetic app Waiting since 1 houre for ride drivers are accepting the ride and then they call ask for drop location and then canceling the ride after 15 mins 20 mins as if Im there fathers servant to wait all day long Ola is wayyyyy better option because theres drivers dont call to ask this nonsense question hatee hatee this app It ia not at all good for women to use becz in case of emergency we cant trust uber,1
509,Lack of professionalism of drivers and rude behaviour lack of support from customer serviceand for gods sake tell your developers to code location detection Most of the time it determines wrong location of destination Very very very bad experience,1
510,Uber provides top rated services Nd the very best but gps services need to be improved little bit while booking since many customers had been facing the issue  And uber fare should be reasonable enough to pay Thank you,4
511,Uber added a feature for drivers to transfer the call What the drivers now do they calls and ask where is my destination If they dont like the destination they just transfer the ride It increases the waiting time In this situation I use other apps when it happens And my Uber usage has dropped significantly for this,5
512,Worst Ride Sharing app to travel from Otopeni Airport Very unprofessional drivers 90% of the drivers will just cancelling your trip if is too short for them Uber Romania become something similar to regular cab service in the time when they arrived here in Romania,1
513,Uber has become a joke Drivers do not pick up short rides or low value rides Even if you choose the most expensive option you will wait forever and still not get service You will see the drivers online in your area but they dont accept the trip The R20 fare is a even bigger joke,1
514,Driver took my money in cash and did not updated the trip payment Now I have to pay the same fare again before I pay for another ride Your app resolution center have no way to mark right complaint or any customer care Very unprofessional and hate this app and switch to OLA,1
515,Worst services of UBER drivers cancel the rides every day basis I always get late for the office due to this Last week I book a can at 615 PM and driver cldidnt cancel my ride and continusily disconnecting my call Then again I book the ride and drive was on waiting for 15 mins then after 1 hour I got a cab through OLA I was waiting in road alone till 715 PM  bad services ,1
516,The app is ok but it has been charging me 10 dolars a month without any consultation or email for the past year that i havent been using uber for some discount membership Not happy,2
517,Why the hell you dont have any customer care number and chat service in your app Where customers can contact you in case of complaints Please provide cc service first then provide other service Spending hours to reach cc but yet not able to connect,1
518,I have been charged 3 times for a single trip and theres no way for me to phone Uber I can only send a note No chat option nor phone option Terrible My advice is  stick to Careem in the UAE,1
519,Pathetic servicecharging customers even if they hadnt took the rideI booked the cab service yesterday but the driver without even picking me up started the rideAs It was a wallet linked paymentit got deducted automaticallySeriously very bad servicenext time Im gonna think hundred times before taking an uber ride,1
520,Uber is amazingly disappointing The amount of times I have faced no rides available in the past two days is astonishing Drivers have asked us for our drop location and instantly cancelled We use uber for convenience and not to face more hassle,1
521,I have paid for everything in uber yet still says charges are pending There is no support from the customer care to resolve the issue I am disappointed with uber services,1
522,Very bad service as well as customer support from ubereven for paid trip its always showing pendingI wrote for many times on Help section in appbut still no solution or even no reply,1
523,Worst service I have booked cabs 45 times but no one come I have waited more than 20 minutes but no cabs come cab driver cannot attend call and he asked first payment mode when u was told him online they cannot come and cannot attend call and when I was cancel ride it is taking charg OLA is Best then Uber dont book any person uber we getting lose our money and time,1
524,Thanks to your service for customer support am going to uninstall this app even a month pass you never contact for my issue hell service i have written this review on 19 January shown below Worst type of help center no contact number no customer support by chat only u can contact after a ride Last day i lost my keys in a uber mini mehran i tried to much to approach u but no response yet,1
525,Worst app No customer care support I am forced to pay duplicate charges applied on my account after sending may mails then too no response from customer support team No able to book rides due to duplicate charges,1
526,I use uber daily What Im not happy with is waiting several minutes for a pick up then saying you cant find a driver then the price has increased by £4 in 3 minutes,2
527,Would be useful if we can rate the drivers that cancel the trips without any reason It is the second time Ive been waiting in the cold for about 20 minutes because cars have canceled,2
528,I booked a ride to fetch me from the airport It then said Error choose another pickup point To which money still came off my account and i cant get a refund because it shows no upcoming trips I want my money back,1
529,Uber is hopeless We experienced trouble in Vadodra and then in Udaipur in getting a cab Either the drivers wouldnt come or cancel The worst experience was at Delhi Airport yesterday Four cab drivers cancelled after calling me and finding out the destination It was not in a remote area but Palam Vihar I had to cancel and opt for Meru which was excellent What pains me more is that there is no way to give feedback to Uber when the drivers repeatedly cancel the rides I am removing the App,1
530,I travel Calgary to Vacouvwr regularly once a month I use Uber from my work place to Van Airport Cost was about $45 but begining of Jan 2022 Uber charged $10034 for same disance if the rate can be change huge then why Uber says they are cheap i used to park my car closer to Van airport to pay less for ride cost generally about $9 or so in 2021 same distance $16 something Was not Uber supposed to be less enxpesive than taxi I will look or other cheap apps that same like Uber Shame Uber,1
531,What rubbish is this of taking photos when i want to travel Such a bad idea no comon sense Even if i had time to waste to start taking pictures like i have nothing else to do how does it help if i remove the mask immediately Why is a perfectly working app being destroyed by time wasting nuisances,1
532,Waste of time for using this app And doesnt have customer care at least to raise complaints They charge for cancellation for our side But they dont bother about their cancellation and waiting time,1
533,Nowadays the app just freeze on its own  it doesnt even notify you if the driver has arrived even after update it Uber also deduct extra money on our trips without our authorisation I used to enjoy Uber a lot now I must say I am very disappointed,1
534,Really waste of time No one is ready to pick at the location And also not canceling the trip and when I cancelled the cancellation charges are applied When I raise complain no one is responding,1
535,For some reason the drivers in Chennai dont want to go through They take the ride and then ask the customer to cancel the ride but give the money in cash to them To avoid sharing the fee with Uber And the best thing is that you cannot complain to uber about them there is no place in the app where this is possible,2
536,Its been impossible getting a ride lately Ive waited up to an hour to get a ride despite the amount of drivers in my area which is a lot Its become unreliable,1
537,Worst experience ever I booked INR 170 trip but Uber charged 323 at the end of the trip It happened to me more than twice Not good service at all,1
538,Today I paid the full fare but my driver has reported that he has not received the full amount But Im not able to connect Uber anyhow No user friendly complaining options are there This is ridiculous,1
539,There was an offer if you pay by Amazon pay then you are eligible 50% up to 70 rupees I have tried and to swich Amazonpay for bill payment but it couldnt process due to error on application if i could have use ola then I would have beneficial,1
540,There is no customer care number and given cc number is invalid in google Driver cancelled the trip then why should i pay cancellation charges Already uber deducted 169/ selfly from my paytm wallet without any reason And now asking 20/ cancellation charges Why,1
541,Its take lot of time to book a trip If at all booked the driver will call and ask whether its cash or online if its not cash then driver will deny the journey And ll tell us to cancel the trip If we ask them to cancel then they ll deny And in the end we ll be forced to pay the penalty The worst part is there isnt any support option in the app at the time of booking,1
542,No schedule option In Manchester and I used to be able to create a booking for eg 1 hour from now But the option has disappeared,1
543,Im getting Something went wrong Error pop up when trying to login Unable to report problem to Uber support because the button to attach screenshot is not working Screenshot is mandatory in that form,1
544,D grade services 100 out of 100 for uber because uber can not manage own business partners ( drivers) Everytime drivers ask for locations  payment mode and calcell the bookings Very frustrating  cheap service They dont have value of time,1
545,Im so irritated by your maps like literally when were in hurry early in the morning your maps just make it worse by stating the longest route possible It not only gets us late by 5 to 7 mins but also gives us so much of mental stress Like SO MUCH,1
546,The wait time is quite ridiculous nowand drivers who are far away tend to accept rides when theres someone nearby Drivers are very picky with the trips they accept now,2
547,I am so disappointed with your services in recurrent days I booked a ride in motorbike in Kolkata todayfrom RGKARMCH to MACHUA FRUIT MARKET MG road When i booked my ride after some time ride got cancelled automatically continuously it repeatedly occurred 45 times horrible I didnt expect such issues from a multinational company like yours Kindly resolve these issues and get user friendly,1
548,Utter garbage  there are never any drivers around and when there are theyll either reject your trip or cancel on you after making you wait for half an hour I suggest you use ANY other ride service than Uber They are worthless,1
549,Unable to get ride pass due to technical error Paytm has money but it is not taking it from it But still I am happy with uber I will give 3 stars here,3
550,Worst experience the drivers here ask u destination and cancels the trip How about depending on this facility during an emergency In total 5 cancelations today Still waiting for a ride Better switch to another app,1
551,Cab driver refusing continuously to go on ride and asking us to bear the cancel charges because neither they want to complete the ride nor they want to bear the penalty of cancellation If we do not cancel they just Playing the same game by transferring it to another drivers and game goes on for a long duration,1
552,Ridiculous service You are at the mercy of the drivers They will call ask for the drop location and cancel If you are in a rush then you must avoid Ola and Uber,1
553,Earlier the drivers arrived promptly but off late it takes too long for drivers to accept the request even when they are close by and also there is frequent last minute cancellations,2
554,The worst ever customer service I have come across My rider account got uninstalled because of factory reset occured in my handset Upon reinstalling the app it came up with the details of ride made in 2016ridiculous Im a Corporate Rider and have been taking rides on a regular basis almost daily I have been pleading with them to reactivate/share the details of the trips made between Oct 21Feb 2022 also furnished them proofs for verification but to no avail As a resul Im losing money,1
555,Wheel chair access at affordable rates Was really surprised to see an option like that to begin with and further the charges seemed very reasonable (similar to XL) despite the automatic lift for wheel chair and professional driver,4
556,Last Monday I paid through cash but yesterday when I booked a ride they cut my money for Mondays trip that i already paid  And when i tried to reach customer care and help option in uber it was not getting options and not responding  It already happened before also with my friends account uber is just looting money for no reason  Its the worst app experience i ever got ,1
557,It has worst accessibility experience When someone is stuck in any problem and he want to review he cant do it because app has some default options for problems and we are bound to choose only from them We cant even call to customer care,1
558,Recently for the past few month uber drivers have not been accepting my trip and I can wait upto 45 mins for a driver to accept it I do late shifts most days and CANNOT RELY on uber at all At around 5pm  9pm it just comes up with a message stating uberx is unavailable What a joke More like lazy drivers,1
559,Showing wrong timing Cab arrives after a very long time Time of arrival indicated before the trip is wrong Most of the drivers ask for destination and cancel the trip,1
560,The app ignores settings to not receive notifications except in relation to trips I have opted out of all push notifications yet Im still receiving them This is spam,1
561,Terrible service More often than not your rides are cancelled by the drivers Have to wait for hours before a driver picks you,1
562,Worst experience as the days are passing by I dont know how they are getting such high rating Drivers refuse destination making us wait almost 2hours still not arriving at pickup So many issues with the drivers yet we the customer have to pay charges for their non arrival Why And really hopeless management even after all the complains nothing changes,1
563,Pathetic Was not able to cancel the trip The button just doesnt work When I booked a trip for someone Fix the damn bug,1
564,Very bad recent experience Driver always asks where I want to go and then cancel the ride But previously Uber was a very good option for traveling in Kolkata Why does Ola not penalize drivers for canceling We have penalized Rs 50 every time for canceling after waiting a long time Very bad experience,1
565,I am truly disappointed  was left stranded waiting for 30 minutes when I reserved an UBER yesterday  received confirmation via email for this morning between 06:2006:30 am This resulted in me not being able to go to work  not getting paid Will Uber reimburse me for the pay that I lost  inconvenience caused Please provide an email address so I can forward my confirmation email from UBER Doesnt UBER care about their clients anymore,1
566,I book a ride to reach railway station for early morning They show me 15 min to pickup then 2 min to pickup from my location  After seen 2 min suddnly they show 24 min At last i didnt reach station and my train depart from station Wrost service,1
567,Why does it take forever to get the 54 digit code for registration Its very nonsensical Its immediate for Uber in the United States of America,1
568,Worst Experience Booked a ride for 102 rs and the driver himself cancelled it and refused to go Uber charged me 84 rs cancellation fee I would have rated this app 0 star if there was any option Uber return my cancellation fee then I can try to change my rating The driver was very rude,1
569,Drivers cancelling rides before 1 or 2 minutes of given pickup timeIts became very routine nowIts not the first time and its happening anywhere in HyderabadThere is no way to report the issue to Uber 17/Feb/22 Its became more worst than earlierAddition to the above now no one accepting ridesI am unable to know the reasonIs it same for everyone Is there any chance to resolve the issues,1
570,Driver started the trip without us and ended the trip after moving to some distance My mode of payment was Amazon pay and my amount was deducted for the trip No customer support number to contact,1
571,Finding that drivers cancel bookings when they get a better trip maybe from a rival firm like Ola They use excuse that not wearing a mask which is total rubbish and you cant report that to Uber cos the app only allows to contact support for trips that have completed and not cancelled by driver No way to contact support via app is very poor,1
572,Worst app Theres no functionality to raise query about driver Why do I have to pay if the driver cancels at the last moment Not at all user friendly Use Ola/Rapido,1
573,Drivers cancel the trip multiple times and if we as a rider try to cancel it (after waiting for 15 minutes until they keep cancelling) then we are charged cancellation fees Booked Uber Rental for 2 hours 2 drivers cancelled then finally third arrived but he was in hurry to finish the trip and behaved impolite when I asked for stops Completed the trip in 40 minutes and got charged for entire 2 hours,1
574,This app hasnt not worked in Edmonton for months Everytime you book a ride it says oops there was a problem and your request is cancel It is completely useless,1
575,I tried to book a cab but got out of the app and closed it It still booked a cab without prompting Kindly check this and fix if possible The cancellation costs,1
576,Useless with no customer care number If driver cancels we have to pay At times drivers cancel as per their convenience Try to send a package rider will come to your doorstep and cancels This sucks🤬🤬🤬🤬,1
577,I had booked a ride and there is no response from driver since 1 hr he was not come to pick me and if I cancel the ride uber charged me for cancelation and there is no customer support who help to come out this and complaint against this issue Third class process of such big company,1
578,I cant see my schedule trip There is no helpline number or chat There is no customer care I dont have any option to rate this app less than 1 star,1
579,very bad experience i had booked cab in advance time and then it was showing 20 minut late then booked time and in end driver has cancelled the request on last moment and then i have booked auto he was asking 50 INR more apart from regular payment when i have refused to pay extra rupee he has asked me cancel the ride when i have cancelled ride then uber have charged cancellation fee for that moreover i was not able to reach at destination so i jast missed my booked bus which was around 900 INR,1
580,Tried requesting more than 8 times and it kept on saying oops something went wrong please try again later but it kept on deducting money from my card literally more than 8 times,1
581,Worst experience ever I have formatted my phone and then tried to login to Uber app but not able to login Reached uber support several times by writing emails but still issue is not resolved,1
582,Used the Uber/Uber Eats combo app It deducted a tip (separately) without authorisation They have stated that I entered in the (very strange) amount manually through the app which is factually incorrect and dont seem concerned in the slightest that fraud has been commited Reported to my credit card company Irresponsible and dishonest company where clearly your credit card details are compromised in the app or the app is glitchy,1
583,Dont use this app they are greedy developers Woke up at 5am check the app said 32 to get to work go back and lay down til its time to leave to find out price increased to 62 (because theres like 10cm of snow) Well I said screw that opened up Lyft and guess what it was still $32 Uber you people are so greedy I would swear you were a mobile phone game developer Lyft > Uber Will never use Uber again,1
584,I was cheated heavily on my last visit I dont know if you all do the same but in my last trip I have charged Rs 30 extra The journey charge on my phone was showing Rs 18 while the Uber driver was showing Rs 48 which is different from mine,1
585,This app charged me an extra fee for a request I did a few days before the trip according to them (It was the first time I ever used uber) This company is a scam Next time I will be calling a cab,1
586,Used to be my go to Very poor service of late Drivers accept trip then request that you cancel Drivers take forever or dont arrive at all Really bad,1
587,TodayI had too pathetic experience I booked cab from vasantKunj to चाणक्यपुरी it showed 5minthan 67 to 8 minsand driver was not picking the callfrom 324 pm to 345 I waited and than I have started for some another optionI m senior citizenand had to depend on it,1
588,They accept and then they cancel the ride continuously 3 times this happened today and not only today many times in past And sometime i dont find driver also Disspointed with the service,1
589,Very bad and poor app drivers are book and then cancel the ride One tyme in emergency i booked cab one day before the trip and next the 67 drivers accept the booking and after 5 min they cancel the ride,1
590,Worst service After booking driver will call and asked whether it is cash or prepaid If prepaid they are canceling the ride Never come on time for pickup Ola is best,1
591,What should I do if I refuses to tell destination to driver and drivers keep canceling the trip  it became like a habit for almost every driver It doesnt matter if its a short ride or long you have to tell your destination if you want a ride,4
592,App is fine but the whole idea is a con its funny how there are no drivers around when prices are at base but as soon as prices double a driver is 1 minute away,3
593,Not only has the waiting time for drivers to accept a trip gone up by a lot but becoming more and more frequent for drivers to accept my trip only to then just cancel shortly after and leave me to start the searching process all over again,3
594,I was charged 70 dollars for a trip that is usually 20 no way to contact support as it just says its what I agreed to Which it isnt It showed about 22,1
595,I have paid cash to driver and in app its showing pending This is second time where i Facing this issue Worst app and there is no way to contact customer care Please dont download this app,1
596,Not very good customer service If there is outstanding balance because 1 card didnt work there is not manual button to charge a different card u have to message customer support and get you food 3 hours later,1
597,Drivers are very very irresponsiblethey transfer ride to another one driver and didnt pic calls alsothey accept the ride if we have to go airport or any other long route otherwise they transfer or force us that cancle the ride if we havent cancel the ride they change our location and transfer our booking to other drivers Its very very bad experience with this app Ill not recommed this app to anyone,1
598,Worst service ever Im waiting for a cab from an hour still no sign of any cabs nearby me Pathetic service and app instead of this app Ill go for ola now,1
599,1) Scheduling a ride is very complicated 2) Prices are very high 3) Unable to add payment method 4) Unable to book a car 5) Past rides are not available,1
600,After you request a trip you cant see where your driver is or even if the trip was successful I logged a complaint that I was debited and got no confirmation that my ride was requested please fix this bug,1
601,All the drivers call and ask for the location and cancel if they dont get the info or dont like the location airport booking has become a nuisance in specific,1
602,Worst  always drivers keep cancelling the rides Why to maintain app like this if no one is coming for dropping  Had to wait 1 hour only for confirming the cab,1
603,Unusable Rejects my payment methods so we can only use it on my wifes phone with the same debit card Used to be good but not usable any more,1
604,The app is good but i have one complain that i have booked auto i have not cancel the trip but then also they fined me 12₹ I dont have any problem to pay the fine but then why to fine But over all the experience was great Plz just see to it It wont be happen next time,3
605,The driver showed up and refused to take my daughter to school before she even got in the car the the company only refunded half of the cost that you have to pay upfront This is a rip off to not get a service but get charged half the fee I will never use this service again,1
606,Every time drivers are cancelling the trip post checking the destination Dont show off the bloody dropoff time before booking the ride It is irritating,1
607,No rating for this app and the comapany I cannot report issues only help option is available and poor customer service This company abhors irresponsible and uneducated old fools I regret using this app and engaging their service,1
608,This is not a taxi service just an app asking drivers whether they can be bothered to pick you up Also dont feel confident if a driver picks up your fare they are likely to drop the ride when they realise they might have to drive further than a mile,1
609,Poor service Very disappoint with customer service and driver behaviour I had to pay extra cash since my recent rides and customer care also ignore the complaint about driver rude behaviour Request to management to improve this type of poor service,1
610,Horible drivers I booked a uber and the driver came and while we were going the destination which i choosed i noticed that the driver was taking longest route and he was opening ola app so that i could not notice that he is taking the long route so that he can take more money from me I am upset with this uber service and i am not going to use this app instead i am going to use ola and i am going to do a police case on uber Please help me find that driver bcoz he must be looting many people,1
611,The app is getting worse and the drivers are getting worse Had a nasty driver recently with bad attitude he dropped me off randomly somewhere on my journey after arguing with me They think you are doing them a favour by taking a trip when in fact you are paying their wages He was a nasty un confident driver And they had the nerve of charging me for the journey And it was a wet windy day When we had all the bad weather at night,1
612,There is no option to call your customer service when a customer requires a quick assistance should he first navigate to your app The driver is harrasing me by not picking up my phone not cancelling the trip that he does not want to take so why should I pay you people as cancellation charges when your driver is not ready to take the trip Since there is no other platform to register my complaint I am giving you a 1 star rating,1
613,No option to report cab not moving /progressing towards pickup Location No option to report cab drivers who call and ask for drop location and refuse trips ,1
614,Continuously spams me with push notifications despite disabling them in the app Comfortable in the knowledge that I cannot disable them at Android Notifications level as I need them for ride updates Worst app Ive ever installed,1
615,Uk Drivers keep accepting and then cancelling Havent been able to book anything with uber for weeks They will just waste 20 minutes of your time until your switch for another app Go for any other concurrent directly,1
616,First of allthis app is greatIve had many trips succesfully doneBut there are many issues that Im havingI was going to Adabor MonsurabadLatif Real EstateI checked if the location was correct many timesand it wasBut atleast three timesthe location changed to LalmatiaLatif real estatethe place Im pretty sure I never went toplus my location didnt showI was surprised the first moment it happendI had to pay double fare for thatI hope Uber fixes this becasue its a very big problem,2
617,Called an Uber He accepted I sat waiting for him but he never moved Had to cancel Please add the option to report drivers for this They should be penalised for accepting and then just sitting still forever without moving,1
618,App is now fundamentally broken  every time I go to request a ride it says Oops something went wrong without providing any troubleshooting advice or means of contacting technical support,1
619,It was worst app was show 436 amount till i have reached my destination n than its change n show 589/this is worst servicethis is second time happened to mei havenever asked its driver to change the route,1
620,Its not showing my ride online maps details currently where I am and location destination taking much time for navigation and its not clear 70% oth screen occupied the car aut sidan etc there ahou be a slide up and down,2
621,For a recent trip they have charged me an additional amount of 355 inr The trip charge of 176 inr was also charged This is daylight robbery When contacted the uber says it is for a pending ride amount from 2019 I am shocked how false claims are made by uber Never use this app else they will rob you for sure,1
622,many of the drivers doesnot known how to reach the destinationthey leave us in the middle of the tripdont prefer this Update : drivers are first accepting the request and cancelling the trip What more can we expect from you guys,1
623,Customer support is really good All done through the app Took time to raise a request but the issue was resolved to my satisfaction Only problem is : if I pay the driver via Gpay or any other online mode the app still shows as payment pending And Ive to raise a complaint everytime If this could be resolved then Im happy to use this service and would also recommend others to use this app instead of OLA,4
624,If youre using the food option on the app its impossible to order so if youre hungry dont waste your time better use another food app,1
625,Horrible experience I had a trip which was 102 rupees till the destination point but the cab broke down 1 km before the destination still I got charged 107(I dont know why there were additional charges) rupees and had to take another cab and give him money as well Yesterday too I had a very similar experience Uninstalling it for sure,1
626,Extremely poor ride availability Expensive and doesnt offer coupons or discounts Condition of the vehicle is very bad Poor hygiene bad smell shabby condition inside out Not worth to travel in such an undermaintained vehicle specially during Covid19,1
627,Booked my uber to reach a destination in advance Driver was changed couple of times Then the ride was cancelled by uber/driver at the last moment I had to book 13 cabs urgently and reached to the destination,1
628,Worst service Dont club your credit card details to uber account They deduct unpicked Trip charges I lost 13299 rupees on January I noticed it After getting credit card statement but uber customer care department telling i have to report it within a week otherwise they wont refund it,1
629,In a way location was not correct during the drive Not able to track tha location It was showing incorrect current location and there is no option to refresh the location,1
630,Uber used to be great Now the rulesfees and behaviour of drivers makes the it very poor Cant compete with normal taxis now No idea id the drivers turn will turn up Drivers are allowed to cancel on you after keeping you waiting for your ride Its clear the drivers cherry pick theirs jobs Cancellation fee for riders but i guess not for drivers The app ok theres not much to it but the issues lie with how the business is ran and the management if its drivers,2
631,Worst experience They mentioned one rate while booking and charge extra amount later Its better to take the local Auto or taxi and support them I believe My mistake,1
632,Totally failed of Uber services  Most worst problem is not available any customer care service last ride details driver details  I advise all people do not install this app  Poor poor poor ,1
633,Worst app I booked a black van to Narita Airport The app took the fare first but kept saying We couldnt find black van for an hour so I just took the GO Taxi app I still dont know how to get my fare back They just took my money without giving me a ride,1
634,Pathetic system Driver are great but the IT system behind things is a mess 3hrs for pick up as app auto cancels trips And no manager or supervisor available to answer questions Ridiculous,2
635,The process is horrible Drivers can cancel at their will after asking for drop location but when we cancel a trip because cab isnt moving Uber charges you a penalty Pathetic process,1
636,Down to 1 star for lack of customer service** Offering 40% higher rates and 10 seconds later dropping to normal rate (after reselecting the destination) is a big No No,1
637,Very disappointed recently with the way they have been treating the customers always used uber from a long timebut nowadays not upto the mark,2
638,Theres no option to cancel your cab searching process if they started searching cabs nearby it take 5 mins and if in between you want to cancel or go back to home page the app doesnt allow you to do so,1
639,Really pathetic experience booking your cabs It takes forever to confirm a ride even with premier booking And your other drivers keep cancelling rides Sort it out,1
640,Useless app Drivers keep cancelling Takes very long time to get a cab Drivers are demanding extra money I have stopped using uber,1
641,Very much disappointed with uber your drivers cancel request without any reason  They dont even pickup phone calls They charge extra money They behaves rudely How can anyone trust you if you cant provide us with good facilities and support there is no way to complain about any driver who misbehave without taking the ride You multiply trip fare by multiple folds for no reason and delay What is this behaviour didnt expect this type of behaviour from uber Looks like its time to switch,1
642,Drivers are soo careless n irresponsible I have booked a ride many times atleast 8 to 10 time but every time Drivers call me ask about the location and cancel the ride again and again Noone really wont accept this behavior Please do make sure that your Drivers wont cancel the ride after accepting it,1
643,They are okay I only use them im desperate My last experience My driver arrived But he took 4 students home instead I was right there Showed him my phone with my booking He just left me at 2am in morning alone I wasnt happy Only saving grace was that they got me new one fast,3
644,Used to work well but now its almost impossible to find a car then when you do the driver cancels on you Uninstalled,2
645,Uber trip prize is higher compair to others and charge your trip 2 time if you paid in cash to driver Same incident happened with me Uber charged me 304 rupees 2 time after 3 year of trip When I took ride that time I paid in cash to the driver On 11/02/2022 Uber charge me again when I approached costomer care they replyed that after 90 days we can not take any complain related to trip and refused to hair my concern Same case will happen with you in future so big big big no to Uber,1
646,Pathetic service It was good initially but over the years it has deteriorated so much Uninstaller ths app Switching to OLA,1
647,Hello uber team I need my refund for my last canceled order I ordered pizza for a birthday party Due to the app being stuck I see it loading for a long time and it is not processing my order so I cancel my order and request a refund and it says it will receive within 3 business days But I received an email as my as Cancellation fee LKR 278100 for an order I did not receive I need my payment back Please dont Stealing money from people,1
648,Worst service ever Uber driver Bhupender car number HR73A7433 called and asked for destination and then cut the call after knowing and I waited for him around half n hour So useless app if this is the behaviour of the cab drivers,1
649,Really poor management Account disabled after signing out from one device and cant login in my other phone And there is no any phone number to contact and resolving that issue,1
650,Worst app Worst drivers in uber they ask directly drop location n cancel the trip It will be happen from 5 to 6 drivers for one trip The drivers are really worst n uber does not improvise their drivers,1
651,Funny how drivers can cancel whenever they want (yesterday they cancelled 4 times and they were 6 minutes away) with no penalty and when I had to cancel because I was already late for my meeting Uber still took the money,5
652,The worst ever app seen for traveling No single support from team if have issue with the service Recommend all to switch on other platform by not investing your valuable money and time here If I Had Minus rating for app Ill gave it to this Worst worst worst app for travel service,1
653,Everytime I book a cab driver calls and ask for destination and cancels the ride and forward it to another driver and this process keep going on and on until price hikes Do something with cab cancellation policy,1
654,Worst service No option to register complaints against drivers Amount charged for the trip even when I didnt travel,1
655,From last 3 days we are unable to get a ride It just keeps on searching searching but the cab isnt booking and it shows as no cars available,2
656,All the following benefits of using uber are now down the drain: 1 No cancellation from driver 2 Clean car 3 Air conditioned car 4 Online payment The drivers are not offering even one of these,1
657,I have waited a driver named Gustavo since 5pm and its 6:51pm and no service yet it shows making stops elsewhere I called and was told he would cancel but all he did was pass me on to Lucero And she tells me too bad I have to cancel the service and pay the additional 45 pesos This is the first time and Ive waited too long and my card has need charged already with 25179 this is ridiculous,1
658,It is not at all convinent waste worst service ever the drivers cancel the ride as per their convenience which is not at all excepted I waited for 15 mins for the vehicle to come But then it was cancelled by the driver side I did not like the service at all Hope to see some side of the uber,1
659,1 Drivers wouldnt pick up calls 2 Drivers will ask for destination 3 Driver wouldnt come also wouldnt cancel trip 4 You might have to wait >30min to get a car after all sort of rejections 5 Asking for 72/ parking fee in cash from the Howrah station,1
660,So I received a 40% off next 10 rides promotion on Mondaywhen I used the app no discounts were given and when I queried this I was informed that it is expired Really annoyed with Uber,1
661,Uber is very fraud Everytime when I booked a ride I choose Cash payment option  after the ride I pay Cash to the driver but next time when I try to book a ride again it ask for completing last payment I did many times for booking next ride Why such That means I paid double fare of so many rides Recently I came to know about this when I booked frequently that I was paying double for every ride Cash payment to the driver  online payment for next booking What type of service is this,1
662,Demand parking charges and after booking demand extra 2 rupees per minute even passenger not able to reach railway station due to railway signal Extra money charge so very bad experience,1
663,Worst experience ever I was overcharged upto 3 to 4 times more than the original amount The driver showed in his app a higher amount and when the ride ended i got a receipt for a lesser amount and when i complained to them with proof they said they cannot do anything Highly disappointed,1
664,Very bad experience on this application Driver not arrived at my lacation and cancel this ride from uber side and then uber charge me 21 INR waiting charge Very bad,1
665,My issue is resolved (i couldnt login i have been trying for 56 months now I dont know the email ID associated with my mobile number So I cant reset my password),1
666,Pathetic experience Booked uber Two different ppl get the same cab booked After telling driver says he cancelled mineBut app gave no updation I was waiting like stupid for cab because it didnt show cancellation from drivers side Here is moreI got charged for driver cancelling my tripthats so annoying,1
667,Very Pathetic service they will ask the destination then they will cancel the ride and problem comes when does not come to the pickup point and starts the ride,1
668,I think this app is very goodtheyve have d iscounted prices but taxis are rather increasing the pricethey have done well they have really done well,4
669,such a pethatic app the riders always ask for place where to go as we already mension destination and after knowing destination acording to their mood the cancil the ride and for next ride wait time is very long and again same process most of time repeat very poor service,1
670,Useless app Just because handset has been changed not allowing me to update Paytm as mode of payment States that it is used for too many accounts,1
671,Earlier uber used to give good service now its terriblepathetic worst The drivers always ask for more money Or else they cancel the trip and as a girl I m saying at night the drivers take most advantage of it they ask for 200 rupees if its showing 70 bucks This is just ridiculousand shameful Uber should take an action on it,1
672,Customer service is very good and responsive Always helpful I was deducted unnecessary for a ride but after complain i got my money back in wallet,4
673,Even if the driver canceled the ride it showing me unpaid payment it wasted my time first for the driver came and also without traveling i have to pay what kind of service is that and most important there is no option to rise my complaint in app,1
674,I booked a cab via uber using debit card When I reached my destination uber driver told me that he did not received any payment My payment is put on hold by uber I paid driver in cash along with extra toll fee I put a complaint in help center but they didnt refund Worst company,1
675,Very bad experience it has many bad chnges in the app please dont waste your time even the auto couldnt come on time n they will cancel the ride earlier it provides best service but now it really disappoint us,1
676,Very annoying experience several times driver didnt came at the promise time what else for more than 20 minutes it is showing driver arriving time sameyour drivers are Very disgusting also their phone also not reachable,1
677,Worst app If we cancel any ride you take additional charges But if driver cancel the ride then what  Your drivers cancel the ride at the end moment just most irritating thing not only once if there is any option to share you screenshot then i definitely share it to you ,1
678,Nice app the problem which occurred was solved by uber support team easy to use sometimes I get problems but support team is very quick they help us in every way,4
679,Before it was good But now a days all drivers are cancelling the trips frequently And allowing only cash payment trips,1
680,They gave intercity ride driver charges fares for state taxes for not even paying toll or state charges They ask people to wait for 10 minutes then say we will cancel ride or pay extra 120,1
681,Unable to book intercity ride in advanced While I am trying to book outstation ride in advanced then it is showing error advanced bookking allowed only on Ride option,1
682,Absolutely worse app and drivers Im writing this review from station because I missed my train which was of 11:58 am and I reached my destination around 12:15 pm that tooo by some other platform I was trying to get a ride from 9:58 am and till 11 am all the drivers were just making the full out of me I missed my train becoz of someone elses unprofessionalism They were telling that theyre on their way to pick me but in reality they were just playing with me Ive an exam to take tomorrow,1
683,App only shows map with ABSOLUTELY no other option at all anymore Cant pick destination or anything it just shows me a map of the world literally,1
684,Only complaint is that the app continues to prompt me to tip the driver even after Ive already tipped The odd time Ill forget if I actually tipped because of this or Ill tip twice by mistake,4
685,Prices are getting too high even when there is barely any traffic back then fares were fine but now they are too high Please do something about it,2
686,Worst app Their driver accept ride then say no and this Uber ask us to pay There is no way to call support You will not any reply on your ticket,1
687,Charging cancellation amount for no reason it was technical error from uber and i have to pay for it its totally disgusting app,1
688,Id give less than 1 star if that was possible Nonexistent customer support drivers never show up charged wrongly for trips/cancellations and much more,1
689,Edit  filled in complaints form a month ago and NO CONTACT BACKPATHETIC LACK OF SERVICE  drivers now pick and chose what they want to accept leaving anyone who wants a short trip stranded for up to 30 mins DO NOT USE UBER RIPOFF,1
690,Worst ever experience faced If you book the cab driver will call you and ask what amount it is showing in app If that amount is ok for them then only they are coming I booked at 11 pm I need to go for an emergency No one came asking amount and they are cancelling WORST EVER EXPERIENCE WITH UBER Change the app name first we dont need to request you And you are not doing free service,1
691,I booked a ride and previously also this had happened so many times Uber motor bike riders cancel the ride due to short trips and this time 10 riders cancelled the rider it was really really disgusting experience from uber not expected The name of the first rider who initially agreed to come but later cancelled was arindam bike number WB20BJ6293 red TVs NTORq He was the first to deny duty after accepting the ride take action immediately or will report to higher authority,1
692,Wont accept any postcode tried to book one in Sowerby bridge but wouldnt accept my postcode so I gave up and didnt bother Their loss Obviously they dont want customers,1
693,i like uber but ill give 1star because of Moto (2wheeler) theyve allways ask the drop locationpricecash or online its so annoying to hear this their duty is to serve customer and if the destination is little bit far they allways charge more shame on them ,2
694,The rate is too high and when we search again then the rate is increasing there is never any offer,1
695,My screen always pop up with useless notifications but whenever I need an rideit is of no use Probably I would not recommend this App,2
696,I used to love Uber then they took away the pay later option so if Im stranded woth no money til payday I now cant order a car and pay later That option has gone,1
697,Worst experience  Fares increase automatically after drop point Sometimes pick up and drop off locations aleo vary on invoice hence the fare,1
698,DO NOT MAKE RESERVATIONS This happened to me a few times: Reserve for 5:30 Uber gives a window of 5:30 to 5:40 for a driver to show up Drivers show up at 5:10 and call me asking me where I am I try to explain that I reserved for 5:30 rush and come out at 5:20 drivers rated me down for being late and now I can no longer find a uber anywhere Im kind respectful and always gave over 20% tip but nobody wants to drive me around because of an obvious flaw in the app Call a cab instead,1
699,Id give the app 0 stars if I could There are never cars available When you do get a car the drivers are far and cancel when close to your pick up location,1
700,I paid cash to the driver for my last trip but still amount is showing pending for me and unable to make another trip No customer service available to discuss this issue,1
701,Not happy with the service  Waiting from last 30 minuter  And as per your map your driver is available within two to five minute over starting point,1
702,This is a complain against uber The driver called and didnt turn up It was a planned trip but the driver never turned up and had to cancel the ride where i was charge a fine I feel this is unfair where we are charged miney because of someone elses fault,1
703,Most of the time the drivers call up to know drop location payment mode and then they stop picking up the phone and cancels the trip,1
704,When l try to bookedall address what l add for every street for Uber is no possible l live in GenevePlane les Ouates After 1 hl booked normal Taxi,1
705,Worst experience ever with this Other apps are lot better There is no use of your drivers accepting our rides just to cancel them again What do you people think our time is worth of,1
706,This app dont work wello use this app everyday as I need to attend my collegeafter using it for a month sowly the fair was increasingfor the same distancenot recommended,3
707,Absolutely disgraceful Drivers accept job then make you wait 5 minutes showing on way then cancel job Happening more frequent now Better off using bolt atleast they dont cancel Cant wait for you to lose your operating licence Uber is not fit for purpose,1
708,Well they have very unprofessional and theift drivers they install and use a harmfull application and they play with riders/ coustmers After they pick you up and from point A and than they play with your route to count More distance with third party app  Uber pak very worst and bad experience I was going usually bahria town to lawrance road 12001250  But today the driver play with my route with third party app  And they generate 3000 RS,1
709,Dear Uber Today morning I was finding a car with Uber and I found some but no car showed their passenger capacities and that why I didnt take any It is very important for us In my previous experience every car usually showed maximum capacity but why not now Well Wishes Sanowar University of Dhaka,3
710,There is no direct complaint interface available for the app as because Uber wants its business only not to hear anyones complaint,4
711,Same as always request a trip 3 or 4 times and eventually some ones picks it up and immediately cancels waiting for the price to go up Il stick to taxis hey are reliable,3
712,I had the worst experience with this appMost of the time the driver cancels the trip First they call and ask about the amount if the amount is less they ask more amount or they tell us to cancel the ride After waiting for 10 to 15 minutes the ride gets cancelled automatically and this app tells us to pay the fine or it will be added with the next trip So tell me why I have to pay the fine if it is the drivers fault,1
713,I paid in cash in a trip in 2019 but now they are charging again that amount in 2022 Not setisfy with Uber service Everytime customer service is not available They why we should use this app,1
714,You will not believe how bad it is I was talking to driver 5 minutes after he arrived the ride was auto cancelled and unable to reach driver the people i ordered the cab for were left outside in the rain this is unacceptable user experience,1
715,Not so good experience Its the third time I schedule my trip on Saturday morning (pick up at 6:306:40) All of them arrived later than 06:50,1
716,My Ride account and Driver account got hacked and the technical support didnt even contact me even after contacting support for multiple times Its totally frustrating UBER have definitely improve its security features as the hackers texted me while I was riding using Uber app Kindly retrieve me account asap Thank you,1
717,They have the worst drivers and customer service Use this app if you want to wait 50 mins for a 20 mins trip thats how many diver cancellations will take place Do yourself a favour and use Ola,1
718,I used automatic payment My ride fee was 74 TRY but the app changed me 101 TRY and there is no customer support or call center for help Uber invoice shows me 74 TRY and my bank shows 101 TRY by UBR PENDINGUBERCO They are cheaters,1
719,It never comes on time You can never rely on autos by uber and the cabs charge a lot for such small distances I am a daily communter and my experience has been pathetic with uber,1
720,I was held hostage in the car because I wouldnt pay the sudden increase to the rate we agreed upon The app said Id pay 155 (trip that normally costs 80) I agreed to x2 rate as I was in a hurry At my destination they changed the price without notice to 217 I was locked in the car againt my wishes I wanted to pay the agreedupon 155 but driver refused to open the doors which had no handles I ended up paying full amount as I was in a rush I shouldve involved the police in this theft,1
721,Been on it for three years and has just gotten worse Its actually cheaper to taxi most places now Less drivers so there is a permanent surge and longer wait times Somerset and bank to somerset and Wellington is 960 in Uber But 770 in taxi So keep in mind Uber isnt a cheaper option anymore And now there is no drivers so my average wait time in centertown to downtown is 10 mins,2
722,I very badly wish the uber app did not have food options There needs to be an uber ride only /lite version for those of us trying to avoid spending on uber eats especially if youre dealing with eating disorders or other mental health issues that exacerbate impulse purchasing,1
723,Very bad experience every time I book cab from uber its taking so much time afer that driver ask for cash and then cancel my ride and its happening minimum 5 to 10 continue for single booking,1
724,Do not download this app I have been charged yet the driver is the one who cancelled the trip Moreover there is no adequate help  so download at your own risk,1
725,Such a rediculous app Ur driver have not sense to talk with customer(women) Yah i cancel little late not because of my own cause its ur app who make me late 20min nd alotted diff drivers despite i called nd msg many time to update 2nd driver talkd very bad even abused Even i was ready to paying cancillation fee,1
726,Very poor customer experience Half the time the drivers cancel their rides upon knowing the destination The lack of professionalism and proper customer service is really infuriating I have dropped multiple complaints over mail but to avail If you put your comment over here we get a standard response requesting us to fill a form of course with no response The other day I was reading about a goon driver who assaulted a passenger on twitter No sense of responsibility whatsoever,1
727,Not too good experience I tried to add all payment option but still its saying this payment option is not available not even Cash  no paytm no any other Option,1
728,Completing trips nearby constant updates long waiting times Really gone down hill,2
729,Used Uber today for the first time and the experience was pathetic They increased the bill amount after the ride ended Also the driver took a longer route as well This doesnt happen in OLA Uber is mean,1
730,Am give this two star for app due to It take long time to accept a ride even if drives are available they will Not Recivie Ride it take Too much time acceptand collecting high prices from daily customer It not fair,2
731,Very bad experience with uber Maximum time moto drivers cancelled their booking I paid full amount to the driver in my previous journey But unfortunately it was showing that Rs 1547 is pending Its very unfortunate I cant contct uber authority,1
732,Uber used to be great but now all you get is drivers cancelling I bet if your trip was over $30 they wouldnt cancel your trip sack these drivers that keep doing it so frustrating fix this issue and penalise them,1
733,Please dont do this We in emergency books a vehicle though the vehicle is nearby they wont accept if he accepts he calls and inquires where to drop when we answer he cancels some people think its fun that they accept and cancel the ride we in the hope waits for the vehicle he comes near and cancels please dont do this Atleast this app doesnt have customer support what the hell please close your company instead of playing with peoples patience I accept before the service was good,1
734,Send messages regarding extra cash paid to driver No response has been got yet As long as my issue doesnt get resolved and i do not get credit of extra amount paid the ratings remains the same I will also not recommend this app to anyone and ask everyone in my circle to give only 1 star rating,1
735,I didnt take the trip someone else took and i was charged for that trip and could not connect to driver no option to connect to customer care for refund also,1
736,something wrong with the app  i booked a ride and the app stopped working after that and i ended up with cancellation charges,1
737,Unreliable what so ever and unprofessional customer support Booked 2 uber bus rides 2 days before the trip that got canceled the same day 30 minutes before the trip I had to choose other costy alternatives and still got late to arrive to my coarse When i contacted the customer support they said that they will not give me a promo code (meanwhile I did not ask for one I just wanted to know what happened just to avoid that in furthers bookings) No response from their side till date,1
738,Better maps and GPS in app complain board of sorts could bring the service to the next level Thank you uber,3
739,Few major things need to be solved considered respected and applied to the Uber drivers too The waiting time period should be 5 minutes once a uber drivers accept the request trip from the clients If the Uber drivers can not be present between 5 minutes the trip should be automatically rejected and redirected to others uber drivers This will avoid any cancellation from the clients for wanting longer for any uber drivers And also not be affected to any bad rating,4
740,Drivers ask drop location only to cancel the ride after waiting for hoursFacing too many issues with the app totally dissatisfied,1
741,Uber is not user friendly I have paid the payment with phone pay UPI Still uber is showing incomplete payment This is the inconvenience for user Now I can not contact to customer care,1
742,This is the worst app If the driver himself cancels the ride we have to pay the charges unnecessarily and waste of time my 1 hour was wasted coz of this app 2 person canceled and I had to pay charge for the next ride,1
743,No rides nearby where even Ola Sedan could be booked Volatile fares and poor policy of blocking the money in wallet unless ride booked which doesnt book usually,1
744,Drivers calls you evey time and confirms the amount and mode of payment if is online they cancells the trip so the next time the amount increases Now a days uber is worst better to look like rapido,1
745,3rd class experience  Everytime i book ride for little far captain cancelsbut if the ride is for shorter distance then it never cancels,5
746,Uber map has a mistake which directed the drivers to drop me (as a passenger) at a wrong location so I contacted Support to report this issue ended up more angry than before Me: Your map has a mistake Uber Support: You dont have Driver account To register as a Driver please upload all the required documents Me: I dont want to be driver Support: We understand but you really dont have Driver account Me: Can you fix the map I have no interest to work as driver Support: (continues to ask me to register as driver),1
747,With uber Ive always faced the payment issue I book with some amount and by the time i reach my destination it increases upto 7080 rupees This is very disappointing as i have faced this eveytime Look into this issue as it is just not right playing with the customers Extremely bad  Never using it again,1
748,Maximum drivers are dont want to go except their preferable location Or else they are asking for extra amount or cancle the call Moreover due to their cancellation Uber has charged me 3times,1
749,I cant add payment methods The page is just blank Im going to use another app Unbelievable,1
750,Drivers cancelling 6 in a row for a pick when they already accepted three Might move to a real rideshare that looks after their drivers so they dont accept competition over uber Firstly check date and time I published this review it happened right at that very moment with drivers waiting at the sunshine coast airport Today less than a month later book and uber price changed 3 times before my eyes between $17 and $57 then back to $19 200m down the road what a joke and f off taking a train,1
751,Unable to add payment methods Unable to add money Unable to book rides Need to hire Devs who are much more than byhearted DS nerds,1
752,Increasing amounts of illegal and intimidating pretrip behaviour by drivers At worst it makes me feel unsafe and at best it wastes a lot of my time when this happens No way to report this to Uber easily Completely unacceptable I have now started to screenshot every time this happens as evidence and it would be interesting to see who else is experiencing this Uber is clearly NOT taking this seriously :(,1
753,Infinity times Worst app and customer service Most of the drivers are demanding for cash Drivers are cancelling trips unnecessarilyBetter If you provide a good amount for the drivers,1
754,Awful no end of problems First it accepts my card then it decided to completely blacklist it I still cannot add another payment method I have tried my girlfriends card selecting cash uninstalled and reinstalled at least three times now with different details and methods (Facebook Google phone number) and every single one is giving an error Utterly pathetic response from customer support the whole time  has left us completely screwed on holiday Avoid at all costs,1
755,Do love how easy the app is to navigate and how quickly and effectively your transport arrives Every driver I have had has been polite and helpful providing a pleasant journey My only issue would be that every now and again the app does play up and doesnt book your ride which resulted in me having to use another company Uber are definitely the lowest fares iv ever used,4
756,I am using uber for quite a long time But from last few weeks I am regularly using it for my hospital visits Most of the time drivers accept the ride but dont come They ask about the destination and keep roaming near the pick up point They wait for me cancel the ride I dont know why they are doing this but this causes lots of inconvenience In this critical time when we are facing lots of challenges we have another challenge to get Uber cab Please Uber resolve it,3
757,Third class customer handling Even not able to relogin the app Unable to stand what the app want for login,1
758,The worst customer support Doesnt even have a call facility and the support system just replied with auto generated messages  PAID THE DRIVER IN CASH AND THE APP (AND THE SO CALLED CUSTOMER SUPPORT) ARE ASKING ME TO PAY AGAIN No honesty whatsoever Even refusing to clarify it with the driver upon multiple requests Total cheats Do not recommend Please use ola instead,1
759,Takes 5 hours to sync my wallet info after fresh login if you have to download and use this app for quick ride booking useless app never depend on this,1
760,and the drivers when they cancel the trip its up to the passenger to pay taxesand the worst when I arrive at my destination uber raises the prices sometimes as it is up to the passenger to pay for the delay when there is too much traffic,1
761,Uber was great when it launched now what used to be a 15m trip takes 30 to 40 minutes Drivers only a few blocks away refuse jobs instead you get a person completing a trip nearby and the wait is 20 or 30 mins The time estimate for a driver completing a trip is often inaccurate and if you cancel because you now want to call a taxi you are charged a 5 dollar fee even if you are cancling immediately after booking and they are still 20+ mins away on another job Next time call a Taxi,1
762,My worst experience driver autocancel it without informing N we cant contact with the driver because there will be fake number given in the app Today i book a ride it is showing to me 92rs but when the trip is completed it is showing 247rs N there will be no traffic no extra waiting time then why they increase the amount 1st we cant get ride because it is autocanceled by the driver and 2nd if in case we get the trip still there will be worst experience,1
763,Very bad experience Im booking for cab Ima Vaiteing for 30 min but not except for my booking Very very worst experience for this app not useing this app,1
764,Even though drivers doesnt come to pick up theres no source to complaint or we cant book another ride and if we cancel the ride because of drivers negligence the cancellation charges has to be borne by customer unnecessarily,1
765,Im usually happy with Uber but this morning I was already waiting outside with my child when the driver canceled at the literal last minute  my destination was 1km up the road and so I imagine he canceled because it was too short I have had a number of friends mention the same thing  that their drivers cancel on them for short trips Thereafter I battled for half an hour to secure a trip even though there were drivers in the area Highly unprofessional  inconvenient NOT recommended,1
766,So I use the app a lot  one day I runned out of battery I saw that I had 7 min for a uber to reach me right before it got shut down  I wait 10 minutes for a car  it doesnt appear I go take a cab  After I charge my phone I find out I get a fee and get down rated  Ok  I will not use UBER app ever again ,2
767,Very unreliable in several ways Do NOT expect this app to get you to work or anywhere else on time The chief issue Im finding is that drivers will sometimes not come to you The app will predict a 10 minute wait but this often becomes 40+ minutes as the driver accepts but then goes somewhere entirely different first They will list themselves as completing a trip nearby I have even had instances where the driver just stopped (in one case for over an hour) and did not come at all  there is a penalty for them cancelling themselves so some will just wait out for you to do so so you tank the fee In this case I left the app on to see what they would do because I wasnt in a hurry but mostly I end up having to cancel after waiting and go flag down a regular cab Reporting this kind of thing is conveniently difficult and the system is automated and pretty terrible The issue is persistent and theyve done nothing to address it The app itself is buggy with a clunky chat system that doesnt load correctly push notifications are delayed and the whole thing is glitchy Its very poorly coded and has a tendency to crash when you need it most even on a new phone If you live in a city like I do you are always faster just going outside to flag down a regular cab,1
768,UNINSTALLY  As whenever I book a ride they (driver) will cancel the ride or they will you you waiting purposely so that you will cancel the ride from your end Exteremly worst service,1
769,You cant enable a simple process of adding a location pin sent by someone as the destination or pickup/ delivery addresswhy ,4
770,I had a terrible experience with uber driver took a much longer route and a day after the ride requested some charges from uber and uber approved all of them without giving me any explanation Trying to contact I was given a generic answer we reviewed yohr ride and everything is fine except that its not as I was taken advantage of,2
771,Pathetic services Its not trustworthy in the time of need Your drivers always cancel the ride Once they know where are we going Whats nonsense They have cancelled almost 10 times Please give them exact location first Stop wasting our time,1
772,This is very stupid customer service I had in my whole life time There is no response and fix on my payment issues for days,1
773,I am regular user of uber auto But now I am frustrated beause of some auto driver I will explain in detail I booked uber auto  they will come to my nearest pickup location spend some time their then he will took other tripafter waiting for my auto I have to cancel trip to book other auto Due to this I have to pay cancellation charges which is equal to fareSo they will get money by cancellation charges and also by other trip So I am requesting you kindly take strong action against him,2
774,Not able to view vehicle number since the past few months Only half of the number is shown,1
775,This is the Worst app which I have ever used It is not at all user friendly One min u will have one option and the very next min it will disappearand doesnt have any customer support number to resolve the issue and there is a supporting team which responds when u raise a incident but it is useless even robots response is better than those team  You money will be debited from your ACC but no trip will be booked They will never dig deep into the issue and resolve it for you Never use,1
776,Worst cab servicehalp section is just a jokewith the worst drivers update left under age child in middle of road alone and no support was given even after complaining,1
777,I downloaded uber app today and faced a very disappointing experience with the first trip itself I booked an UBERGO for going to yenepoya medical college from ladyhill with Rs 255  Even after waiting for more than the expected time driver denyed my trip asking Rs500 Car no Ka26a7411 Chandrashekar My trip was for a medical emergency If he wants more why he accepted the ride Very unprofessional and unethical attitude Worst customer service,1
778,Very high cancellation fee they will charge cancellation fee without reason sometimes the cab will book and cancel so many times very worst,1
779,I have faced total of 4 rejections just now by drivers after they were booked Whenever the passenger cancels the trip he is usually charged a cancellation fee but however when a driver cancels the trip we receive nothing This is highly biased and needs to change We as passengers must be compensated whenever a trip is cancelled by driver,1
780,There is no customer care no In the stupid app Often the drive is cancelled by the driver itself Very unreliable Disappointed,1
781,I requested a trip that was canceled before the driver arrived and my receipt says I wasnt charged yet the money went off my account I inquired multiple times and requested a refund but its been 3 weeks and I get automated responses that they have issues with refunds that they will sort out It was my first time using the app and I am very disappointed,1
782,Not recommended Booked the ride two or three drivers accepted and asked for destination and immediately cancelled it The fourth one accepted asked for destination and then did not come and not even responded to call or message Very bad experience I had to cancel the ride after waiting for few minutes because his was not moving on the map and it infinetely showed arriving in 4 minutes Alternate booking app is much better than this Uninstalled it,1
783,The service is awfuldrivers just want to rip you off too by taking the longest possible routeor wait for a surcharge then want to accept jobs,1
784,Service is getting worst day by day Drivers do not add money in your vallet if they dont have change Customers are charged with cancellation penalty even if the driver himself asked to cancel the ride,1
785,Worst app I have ever come thru100 times driver cancelled my ride really unhappy with the serviceits very rare I use ola uber but both got me worst experience,1
786,I use first time this app but Uber cut too much Euros my ride price 1054 but total i lost money 1054 + 046 waiting + 1564 I dont know why my total amount 2664 Euros,1
787,Very disappointed Alltime drivers are refusing the trip Not a single driver will opt for online payment All of them want only cash payment,1
788,Expensive opportunist taking advantage of monopoly Please look into algorithms used for assigning drivers On purpose they will assign a driver completing a ride nearby(which is nowhere near you) when there are other drivers available nearby When you cancel a ride and say find another driver because wait time was longer the app assigns same driver again or a driver with longer wait time🤦‍,1
789,Hate how this app will choose a driver on the other side of the block from me then send them ten minutes away,1
790,Sometimes drivers cheat by taking different route and then cost goes up However afterwards I got refund and I am thankful for that But this is not right,2
791,The app doesnt even Pins on the location The New UI is worst It doesnt show saved locations like home and work,1
792,Dumb app detects panvel as intercity and charges more I have stopped using uber its correctly detected in Ola and charges less,1
793,This is the worst app to use its better to use OLA atleast they care about customersUber drivers keeps cancelling some of them dont even move for 15 min just so you will cancel and pay fine for iteven though i waited for 45min and drivers kept cancelling they are not letting me cancel ride just keep booking different drivers who are 6km away and not moving at all and keep cancelling DEFINITELY UNINSTALLING THIS APP AND TELLING EVRBDY I KNOW NOT TO USE THIS APP,1
794,Uber should also mention feedback section for those cab drivers who cancelled our ride without our permission and these driver should also pay panelty for cancelling ride without any sufficient reason and customer must receive concession on next trip after ride cancellation by driver,1
795,I have literally waited an hour and nothing happened canceled a few times and requested again with the same result,1
796,High prices rides Subject to the driver mood to accept or reject the ride Long waiting time to get the car Very difficult user experience in comanicating the company Driver can reject a ride because not wearing the face mask although you do while its almost impossible to communicate the company regarding this,1
797,Is it supposed to say Trips booked in advance include extra features like more wait time Shouldnt advanced bookings have less wait time,3
798,Ive had good driver service through the app but rating it 2* because of the maps the way Uber determines journeys as well as the extreme volatility in prices If I look up a particular journey in London (south of the river Thames in its entirety) the maps take me north of the river then back south again increasing my fare This hasnt always been the case but its really annoying There is also the shoot up in price to almost double depending on the time These things need to be addressed,2
799,this ride service is literally the worst i dread having to use it especially when im paying with card because i never know when or if ill get my money back after theyve taken it even when no car shows up the customer service is weird and they make it hard to be comprehensive capitalism is an aggressive cancer to society and i hope you lot at uber some day manifest a moral compass 0/10 stars,1
800,Hey Uber did you know you have an endemic problem with drivers cancelling rides It happened to me and my wife over the course of a few weeks Drivers cancel even when only 34 minutes away Havent been able to book an Uber since December 1 2021 You really need to address the issue and crack down on drivers Best A formerly satisfied customer (but not anymore),1
801,USELESS from last 3 weeks I am unable to add CARDS It Is only taking cash as payment method Useless Irresponsible company,1
802,Completely useless service We found 8 drivers nearby 5 minutes later sorry we couldnt find you a driver Why lying every time I request a ride First you found 8 drivers for £10 then cancel saying UberX is unavailable and couple of minutes later UberX is available for £20/ride Happens 8/10 times,1
803,My previous booking with Uber was very pathetic Drivers would call me and ask for destination or payment mode I answered to first 4 drivers and they never showed up I didnt share the details with another three drivers they too didnt show up It was the ninth driver who did call and showed up He seemed like genuine person rest all eight drivers just kept on bouncing the trip on app Off late this problem has become intolerable I had to wait for 75 minutes for a trip of 10 minutes,1
804,Mostly you will get drivers who tend to accept your booking and then cancel the request which results in so much waste of time Theres no way to complaint against them either because Uber only lets you give feedback on a booking that we have cancelled or have taken Ridiculous service,1
805,The app recently started to have an issue not showing correctly where the driver is Today it happened again and I waited for at least 20 minutes even tho the driver was supposed to arrive in 12 minutes It was showing that the driver didnt move at all from the place where it was at beginning and when I messaged I got no answer I eventually cancelled the trip cause I was getting no update where the driver is,1
806,The app is designed well and is easy to use I used to love uber and its efficient service but over the past few months whenever I have tried to get an uber I havent been able to (usually its not during peak times) The app just loads for a few minutes and then says there are no taxis Sometimes a driver accepts my ride and then cancels it 30 seconds later Ive been stranded in the middle of the city with no other way home because of this I can no longer trust uber for a safe ride home,2
807,Absolute disaster In Paris Ubers will keep you waiting taking other passengers while you wait A 4 mins easily transforms into 20 mins Then they ask you to cancel and if you do  youre charged But if you dont  you cant order a new car This app is unreliable and outdated,1
808,There is no way to contact Customer Care Drivers cancels CAB after knowing destination which waste passengers time alot Worst Service by Uber If I will miss flight today then Uber will be responsible for that,1
809,I am a regular user But suddenly I find that the options are gone I cannot see my completed rides promos nothing A bug or you intentionally removed these ,2
810,Surge pricing is annoying and not even necessary most of the time Also why are drivers allowed to complete another ride or several others before picking you up Imagine if we had a customer is just completing another purchase at a shoe store option,2
811,Worst service in this app mostly drivers cancel the tripDrivers cancel the trip and we have to pay extra very badly experience ,1
812,Very bad service they even not coming to their destination and charge a cancellation fee with meaningless reasons Im very angry and annoyed with it,1
813,The app is mostly broken when used to order food:  basket disappears between pages  discount code failed to fetch but was applied somehow after going one page back and forward again  driver couldnt find the address tried to contact on app but app didnt say I only know because Uber robots rang to tell to check the app Force leaving and reopening the app showed some messages but messages screen would not load Messages preview showed end of day sorry and order was cancelled,1
814,I use Uber all the time and love it But Youll get 5 stars only when you stop allowing drivers to accept rides then not move for tens of minutes Thats easy you have their gps etc Too many times unscrupulous drivers went for my cancellation fee after not moving one meter,1
815,Very bad Service Fare very high first time it will show low price but cab not booked after trying show hight fare and 2nd every driver ask drop location Long distance they will cancel ride,1
816,Hard to get taxis Uber customer support never seems to actually help with any specific queries They give the same responses Lastly the drivers can get away with outright lying about you not wearing a facemask when you are wearing one,2
817,App works 2/10 times and the prices are incredibly extortionate even for small 5 minute commutes to work I get charged £15 and over,1
818,Its really a very bad experienceToday I booked a cab for 341 INR then the cab driver Trying to find shortcut route and he go to wrong location(which he says his map was showing this route not mine map) then he dropped me the right location which is fine But after the ride uber charged me 606 INR why Its your driver fault not mine I didnt changed location or anythingwhy you charged me extra,1
819,Ive such worse experiences with this app One time a driver charged me extra in the app because he had to wait 10 mins as he couldnt reach the exact pickup location Id to pay for his fault as the place was unknown to me and it took me time to figure out where he was parked Another time also Id to pay extra as the driver couldnt reach the pickup point due to traffic and Id to cancel the trip after waiting for about 20 mins I really hope Uber resolves this soon,1
820,When I go somewhere they charge a particular amount and when I back the same distance same place they charge just doublethis app is doing nothing but looting usthey increase the rate as soon as u reach the destination and then u see trip history it shows the same initial price which was shown at the time of booking so that we cant complaintThey are Just playing games I have screenshot proves of my statement also pathetic services These bunch of foolish should close there company,1
821,1 Cant add Credit cards Now even Paytm is not getting added as a payment option 2 Wanted to book an inter station cab Waited 15 minutes in Connecting you to a driver Then just gave up and went ahead with a much expensive option off the internet at the last minute as I had thought Uber would be able to cater to me 3 For intracity cabs as well it takes a lot of time to find a match But they are good and are a much cheaper alternate to Ola Adding a star just for that,4
822,Uber KSA has let me down now on several occasions since arriving in Riyadh When you prebook a ride for a meeting and at the pickup time you get a notification that nobody is available it is unacceptable Whats the point of prebooking if you end up having to book a new ride again at the time you needed to depart waiting 1520 minutes and then having to pay 3 times as much Very disappointed Didnt have any of these issues when using Uber in Africa or Europe,1
823,Getting worse and worse i have a 49 star rating i have been trying for 45 mins to get an uber to no success There were 3 drivers available but they still couldnt get me a ride Horrible service lately,1
824,Hi I am from Guwahati i have very bad experience with uber service not single time but several time All the time I booked driver asked the rate and always asked double the real charges If we ignore to ride they use very bad slung word to us This is really hopeless Uber ride,1
825,App is good Was strunded some where but with in minutes if contact a Uber driver was present,4
826,Not just a poor app to take services people are heartless here I used uber only two times in my life medical emergencies both times at my place At first the driver didnt pick up call again and made us wait for soo long and didnt even turn up At second which was quite big the driver refused shamelessly and cut the call Uber should act as a human being when there is a need to help others for which uber is continously failing A very big no to Uber from not Really disappointed,1
827,Now a new cancellation fee has been added which took me 3 times to realise money was been taken and put aside leaving me to wait 35 working days to get it back Started great but now the prices spike way to often resulting in a £8 journey costing upwards of £20 and for a daily user like me this courses problems so I have to use more then one service Ie bolt or ola  its only getting worse by the day,2
828,When I look at the receipt for my trips I often see wait time while we had no delay or even were there before the car arrived The last trip has a few euros as Tolls surcharges and fees which is completely unclear to me why The route itself has no such thing as toll or fee Moreover the same route had never such fees before either I wonder if these are added automatically by the app or added by the driver,2
829,Im not able to take a trip until I pay a specified amount for a trip that Ive taken and paid much more than the shown amount Tried to contact complain still the issue isnt resolved Do you want me to pay once more for the same trip or uninstall the app forever PS: Try to improve your customer service/ complaint portal,1
830,From my experience the fares increase by as much as 50% if the driver takes a longer route (by being lost or deciding to do so) though no fault on the rider And disputing the increased fare leads to nowhere However cutting a trip short will never lessen the fare and I dont expect it to happen,3
831,A ride that usually costs $23 cost me $63 yet it showed 4 other drivers in area I had to take a two way trip Thats a 200% price increase Im chatting with Uber support which now takes 5 hours to get through because of their new system and there is no option to appeal fare price They gauged my price like crazy simply because it was Christmas They basically robbed me They charged $77 per km What a joke $126 for a $45 round trip ON CHRISTMAS,1
832,Im starving but wanted to make sure I left this review Order your food get confirmation be told your meal has been prepared and your food is on the way Wait an hour then be told randomly that your order was canceled No explanation no attempt to get the food delivered despite it being prepared If you enjoy disappointment and want more of it in your life then I recommend this app If not then I highly recommend you AVOID this app because it SUCKS,1
833,During my 7 years in the UK I had no issues with the app I even traveled to Ireland Spain Portugal France Germany and Italy and used the app without issues However the Romanian app is a nightmare Drivers accepring trips when they are 40 minutes away Drivers accepting trips pulling in front of you and requesting a no show cancellation fee Antivax drivers without masks Drivers acceptings trips and cancelling after seeing the distance,1
834,Hardly anybody picks up when I order despite it usually being like £5 for a 5 minute journey When drivers do pick up half of them drive halfway to me and then cancel Its a joke,1
835,Cannot set delivery time for scheduled order Always resets to deliver now Received order because this was not apparent during order,1
836,Mostly my experience is good but I dont like thing where I have to pay money or fine if I cancel my ride For instance today my driver didnt arrive at my spot when I waited for more than 9 minutes whereas it was showing he will reach in 3 mins I had to cancel him I had to move on And sometimes drivers dont return back my change it does not happen often but sometimes If I had to again argue with the driver I might as well go in a local auto I mostly use the apps autorickshaw service,3
837,The drivers doesnt come for long time so that we have to cancel trip from our side Then uber charges extra charge for the next trip Deceiving customers Dont use uber,1
838,Uber has become useless drivers should not have the cancellation option We book uber to reach our destination early Drivers ask us where do you want to go and cancel the ride if it doesnt suit them Furthermore they also inquire about the fare and cancel the ride Sometimes it takes more than 30 minutes to book We started using local taxi now Drivers should be penalized for cancellation If they do not want to go they should be offline I am frustrated now Finding alternatives now,1
839,It was good before Now the application shows different rates to customer and driver and the customer often has to pay more than what is shown in the app Not reliable anymore Bad experience,2
840,I dont know why I cannot select the arrival point in the app Please check this issue,1
841,I was showed Rs 400 for my trip but bill generated was of Rs 919 which is way too high for 12km It is highly disappointed service from Uber Highly unlikely to suggest anyone about Uber,1
842,It kinda screwed me over this morning Had my trip set up on Uber I click start and it was finding a driver for me A minute goes by nothing 5 minutes nothing At this point I call a cab Cab comes in 5 mins I get in the cab and then uber tells me its found a driver I was dumb to assume that it would autocancel after a set amount of time But nope I got charged $6 for cancelling Just be aware of that  I wish theyd let you pinpoint locations better It gets confusing for drivers,2
843,I find it absolutely ridiculous that we as uber customers are charged a cancellation fee yet the driver could be a minute away and cancel the trip causing a huge inconvenience I was waiting 45 minutes for a ride only for the driver to cancel a minute away from pickup Then I had to wait 15 minutes for a new driver please fix this if we are charged the drivers should be too,1
844,I have used this app for a long time and it has never let me down until recently My account was disabled for unknown reasons and for the last 2 months I have tried to reactivate it through the app emails and no luck at all I cannot complete the reactivation process because the system hangs Can someone help me get back my uber account,1
845,WORST service previously the services were good but now wasting the time of passenger unnecessarily only in searching  finding a ride I have wasted 30min in finding a ride everytime i search its connecting to a driver which is getting cancelled on its own or the driver calls u and asks u for destination and then cancelling if he doesnt like 🤦‍🤦‍🤦‍,1
846,Had been using uber for more than 6 years Unable to book a trip or make an order for food delivery as end up receiving error message as card not acceptable utter nonsense had been using the same card on my old phone Calling the customer care is the biggest regret,1
847,App doesnt work properly and always shows incorrect location and charges are very high its not the first time have used Uber app on different mobiles and have done all troubleshooting as well still you app shows incorrect location even my bills are incorrect and post ride bills also show incorrect be map and drop locations App just keep searching for drivers and hardly find any waste of time in fact most of the drivers choose ola over uber due lack of rides available in the app,1
848,Update: Drivers still cancelling after 15m There should be a penalty for drivers opting to cancel after making you wait for a certain amount of time For example drivers make you wait 1015 mins while they are dropping someone and then cancel This is absolutely absurd and a waste of valuable time Uber currently is a dismal service in Mexico Except in very lucky situations the average wait time for a cab is 1015 mins which goes to 30+ minutes minimum with the aforementioned cancelations,1
849,Definitely not customer oriented Not even have a customer service team Last time I had an issue with my payment and I had to write to them and its been over a month they have not reverted or given a solution Moreover u cannot even cancel a trip if the ride is coming late or else they will add that amount also to ur next ride So definitely not for customers,1
850,Cant upgrade the app as per your recommendation despite many attempts as code given when entered is returned as error Frustrating,1
851,Very bad experience with booking if u cant control ur drivers and our ride what is the use of ur application Today almost 10 to 15 cancellation s I have to wait for my ride For 1 1/2hours to get a ride,1
852,App required to take a selfie Due to a bad android 11 update my selfie camera does not work The app did not allow use for back camera thus was unable to proceed with getting transport App needs to account for options and not just force you out Yes my phone is broken but because its broken I should not be considered failed to comply if outside my control,1
853,There is no option to call customer service number No Easy way to complaint drivers behaviour to support team I really refuse to take service from uber in future,1
854,Wrost app ever I have used in my entire life there is major sefty issue for every cab user There is no any complaint number against driver its hard to get 1 cab driver ever now days Unfaire change uber do in current I would request people to uninstall uber as soon as possible coz uber is doing own business there is no humanity only money left in this,1
855,This app doesnt worth a single star these days I tried booking cabs and auto a number of times at such moment when I wont find any cab or auto nearby but the cab and auto drivers either dont accept the request or if they accept they ask for destionation and keep roaming there only They wont move in my direction or I will face the cancellation Whenever I need to book cab at midnight for anyone I used to prefer uber but nowadays such behaviour of drivers will ruin the hardwork behind the app,1
856,App seems user friendly I like being able to book in advance  see where the car is However recently Im starting to dislike Uber My rating recently went from 495 to 484 with the only difference being is that I now live with a disability so use a walker to get around  take a little longer to get into the vehicle (especially 4wds which I seem to be getting a lot lately) Seems a little discriminatory I cant get the assistance ubers either because theyre never available,3
857,Couldnt book a single ride even after waiting for 60 mins straight I am from Varanasi Here the drivers keep on cancelling rides Moreover only a single driver is available nearby whenever I make a request and not even that at times The service used to be decent in the beginning but it has been consistently going down since then Terrible is all I can say now Completely Disappointed,1
858,I would use it more if the rating system was gone I had a couple of problematic rides in Asia one where the driver got lost in Malaysia and tried to drive us around in circles for nearly 40 minutes for what should have been a 6 minute ride we had to ask her to pull over and just let us out and then she clearly one stared us because my rating took a nose dive and its just absurd to now see that it impacts my ability to get rides in London Ive switched to free now,2
859,You can prebook then the driver cancels for no reason so not only are you late you then have to pay more Has happened so many times short trips long trips You can not rely on this app/company and they so nothing to help you when things go wrong Horrible company,1
860,Bad UX when trying to find the chat to deliver some message to the driver I had to look through every where to find the chat Clicked user profile photo clicked user name click phone icon click many where Finally I got the chat but I dont remember last thing I clicked to get it,1
861,Extremely frustrating experience Theres a cancellation fee of $10 You have scummy drivers who purposely find trouble arriving at your pickup spot or drivers who claim to have made a mistake and wants you to cancel so you get charged and they get paid without actually providing any service This has happened to me three times last week Adding to that if the driver waits longer than 5 minutes they can and will charge you $10 Left something in car $20 to call the uber back to meet you,1
862,Sick of this app that doesnt work sick of them never fixing anything every time I use the app it says that my card is expired when its not Its been doing this for years I mistakenly signed up for Uber Pass and cant work out for the life of me how you cancel the subscription in the help menu it says goto the menu in the top left corner on my phone theres no menu in the top left corner if I goto the menu in the top right corner and it just tells you about Uber Pass theres no cancel,1
863,I paid in cash to a non cash trip as my debit card was not working and my payment method was online The app shows that the amount is still not paid as it was not paid online but in the cash payment Its been a week I am complaining about this issue but there is no response from the other side This has happened to me twice Also the worst thing about this app is that whenever we book a ride the driver calls you and asks for the location if its nearer then they cancel the ride Ridiculous,1
864,Lately the drivers accepts the ride and after a few seconds they cancel each cancel gives a longer distance car for instance today i reached after 3 simultaneously accept and cancel 27 min estimation from 2 min initial estimation I had to cancel it This didnt happen a few weeks ago and its very upsetting especially when youre in a hurry Hope this problem to be fixed in near future,1
865,Worst app to select cabs and make passengers wait long to take the trip Drivers call and wants to know where I need to go and whether I will pay in cash If they hears an online payment they cancel the trip Drivers deny to turn on ACs during summer but UBER charges as AC cabs On any urgency UBER connects drivers who are very far from the pickup point Waiting time to get a cab is minimum 20  30 minutes Drivers cancelling trips are not punished UBER is below average in providing service,1
866,App is awesome but driver are very unprofessional they will accept the ride and went away from ride started trolling away from ride if you call they will ask you extra charges you can not cancel cancellation charge will be deducted from your side there is no complain link in app so its useless to install Where do the ride complain for driver fault,1
867,Normally I would give five stars but already experienced more than 3 drivers who keep you waiting You just see them on the map not moving you write to them and dont answer and when you call them they cancel the trip This is unacceptable as people need to get to places and cant afford to be late Plus why would you charge the customer for cancelling the trip when its actually because of the driver Cant even report the driver if the trip is not finished Edit 15 jan 22: 1 star down,1
868,Since yesterday theyve added this stupid feature of taking a picture of your face with nose mask on before getting a ride Why would I want to give my picture to you What are you going to do with the pictures you aggregate Even at the hight of Covid this feature didnt exist You are bringing it at a time when the pandemic is subdued and vaccines are abound This is just a way to collect data on people and sell it Why dont you ask of a vaccination card instead Im ending my 5yr usage,1
869,Ill give more stars when you remove the 2 suggested addresses under Where to  or at least allow us to select saved locations to put there,3
870,The app doesnt work properly it bugs out a lot Charged my accounts multiple times while saying they cant process my card and decline my payments Ludicrous price fluctuations from one second to another Card works when going but not when returning so I am hopelessly stuck somewhere without cash works very inconsistently horrible experience Once you solve the issue they try to blame on you they present another one and so on it is actually very frustrating I cant go anywhere,1
871,Teapa Drivers cancel the ride before arriving It happened me several times I cant provide feedback,1
872,The app and the drivers are generally good but better screening of the drivers should be put in place For example the driver of car B100XDR came to the meeting point passed by us without stopping turned around and left and then cancelled the trip Not sure why he did that but immediately after he cancelled the trip he couldnt be rated anymore Maybe that should be improved in the app too,3
873,Constant uber pass nag screens are incredibly annoying and a poor example of dark UX practices Uber is getting more expensive than Taxis now,1
874,Poor service Booked a cab at 730 and they kept me waiting for 45 min,1
875,Uber app appeals to me mostly because of the fixed costs which distinguishes it from other similar apps However they have recently begun to add prices for long pick up and per minute costs which has resulted in a rise in the final prices I hope you can revert to the old methods or at the very least disclose a range of expected prices without abruptly raising the price at the end of the trip,4
876,Terrible services drivers can cancel the trip for free and we cancel a trip they will charge us cancellation charges Such unfair behaviour toward customers and such bad driver experience,1
877,Very bad experience so far and this is second time it happened and no action taken against this The amount I paid (523) was high than booking amount (370) The driver unnecessarily took very long remote route Why should I pay more than booking amount Bad service I have proof as screenshot of details how the price was increased after completing ride and now price is restored to original booking price (370) after payment I want my money back,1
878,This service is a complete rip off I was about to book a taxi at £8 (10 minutes trip) Got distracted as my mum needed help Went back on the app for it to shoot up to £23 Happened to my friend when we were in New York Happened to me when I was in Scotland as well Use local taxi cabs Save yourself a fortune Cannot recommend to stay clear of this rip off enough,1
879,So frustrating Whenever in need of traveling somewhere on Bike  the driver always asks for increasing the fare than the actual fair shown And ofcourse we were in a hurry  the we had to pass more few Bikes  then What I got actually just lost valueable times,1
880,You book a ride it will show you driver will reach in 10 min then you wait 5 min And it will show you 20min and when you try to cancel it comes up that you will be charged for cancellation Another update : Still while you are waiting your trip will pass from one driver to another and at last you have to cancel even if you are charged Edit2: the same happened again today 19 Dec however i booked a cab under OLA and i am home now The uber still shows 6 minwaiting even after 1 hour,1
881,Your trip will be pleasure if your destination is drivers wish  mode your mode of payment also drivers wish and your fare also decided by drivers wish very bad experience with uber ,1
882,Feedback is useless And it is impossible to give feedback to Uber (not to drivers) I understand that the number of drivers is getting smaller and smaller and the company must retain them but when this affects me as a client this is a problem Extremely long pick up times (>10min) Driver close by but never at pick up point Refusal of short trips even with 2x or 3x prices Pandemic rules not followed  Pick up and dropoff side of street matters for me I would add more but char limit r,1
883,Now Drivers have started cancelling even before asking for drop location This shows that uber is doing something that the drivers are not liking,1
884,Drivers dont cancel and they dont come to pickup There is no option to complain about it too The drivers dont respond and dont cancel either Moreover you get a cancellation charge on your app if you do it from your end even if its not your fault Worst app ever This happened to me in a very critical situation in hospital and not just once but many timesVery horribly poor Might as well take the one star back Screw this app,1
885,Sadly I have to use this app a lot because of the good prices But dont be fooled Uber drivers constantly cancel and show up late I have had great service from uber customer service representatives when Ive had issues with food orders refunds canceled rides etc But when it comes to drivers they are extremely unintelligent and inconsiderate No courtesy for paying customers time and money For how much money Ive given this company Id expect better experiences with drivers and couriers,1
886,Out of a sudden Uber doesnt accept my Card for payment and I cant add a new payment method (error please try again later),1
887,Used to be good when they first started But the drivers they have now are awful Ive had Ubers cancel on me 12 mins away after Ive waited 15mins Im assuming for a bigger fare But its happened so many times its so frustrating Cant rely on this service Dont use if youre in a hurry,1
888,Bad service especially when offers are given you guys just lie and cheat people because I get to pay even more sometimes So if you know the price of the offer will change keep you offers to yourself ,1
889,I used to use Uber a lot a few years ago but now I only use their competitors apps Like other reviewers I try to find a driver but they either dont accept the ride or they accept wait a couple of minutes then cancel In the end you have wasted your own time and still dont have a ride booked I dont think I have a bad passenger rating,1
890,Worst app I paid for the trip through Phonepe but in receipt it says payment failed It is happening since last 3 days Only one receipt come is OK and rest saying failed transaction I want receipt to show it to our company for reimbursement I even checked if I get penalty in the other ride but no And theres no customer care support searched all over Also there is lot of problem in booking a cab Drivers cancel the ride anytime They make me wait for 2025mins and then cancel the ride During a single trip I have to wait for more than 45min to get the cab Also establish your customer care so that we can find the solutions for issues The help menu doesnt help much Resolve these issue otherwise I have to switch to some other services,1
891,Critic: I live in a city my sister lives in another and for me its really hard (near impossible) to find a driver who will take me there thanks for the price you pay them which is to low Compliments: It used to be good it used now its no more,3
892,These days customers facing lot more problems  After confirmation of the booking on application We are getting call from drivers asking for extra money then only they are going for pick up and taking the customers to ride  Even they are asking for cancelling the ride on application and they are going to take you to ride like personal ride  Today the same thing happened with me I would suggest other people to not go for uber or rapido rather you go for public transportation or personal,1
893,Uber is so disappointing Its so funny to see other customers complain about the same thing but Uber does nothing absolutely nothing to resolve their problems Its now 3 weeks since I complained and asked for this to be sorted out every week I try but nothing is resolved I didnt even take the trip as it was canceled by the driver and then I get charged the full amount and then I keep getting told about Uber fixing their system Give what is due to me so I can finally delete the app again,1
894,the app is an absolute shitshow now the drivers keep cancelling after asking where we have to go the fares are extremely high even though your destination location is just 8 minutes away on top of that the fares dont even match the ones they show us the drivers have become rude sometimes the profile of the car and the driver dont match fix your app Ive been a loyal user for many years but for the past year Uber has not been treating their customers like they used to its disappointin,1
895,Worst Experience Every time your drivers wait for 1015 minutes and refused the trip They dont even Cancel the ride and waste our valuable time,1
896,Frustrated Many drivers accept the ride and then cancel when they know the location This happened with me 10 time in an hour Why should i use uber when i dont get the rides Improve your drivers attitude and fine drivers if they cancel ride based on location,1
897,Pathetic serviceThe fair price while booking is showing very less But after you reached your destination it changed to much higher price than expected Even many vehicle numbers are showing wrong in app Payment is also showing unpaid after payment is done as well and it is not let us book the next trip untill we dont pay again,1
898,After using the service I keep getting spam marketing Emails with questions like why havent you used our services in a while and attached surveys I understang getting feedback is important and thay you can unsubscribe but stillannoying your user base while blindly implementing spaming mechanics in order to mine for additional data might sound nice on paper might while in practice turn people away from your services Uninstalling and closing my account,1
899,One of the worst app which is not useful late night I book a cab but it was cancelled at least 10 times I was not give 1 star also,1
900,Worst experience the drivers constantly cancel the rides and then when the ride does confirms the driver doesnt move from their location i missed my classes because of this stupid app why do you guys even have this app if you guys cant manage it Very disappointing,1
901,The drivers esp the mottos always cancel the rides after asking about the payment shown and if we dont agree to pay them double or more than the price Either the management needs to discipline the bike services/drivers or should see to the pricing problem Besides whats the point of the app if the drivers want to be paid as they wish,1
902,Great and easy to use app except when ordering alcohol You cant check out until you go back and forth a few times so the app prompts you to agree you are over 18 On the side note: Got a quarter of my order and got reimbursed only for the items missing No offer to deliver the missing items no reimbursement for the service fee and tip (£6) So not only did I not get what I wanted I had to order it again and pay for the delivery albeit with a different company Not using Uber ever again,3
903,Recent update: now waiting time is around 20 minutes and even worse you wait for eternity to get diver selected and they cancel the trip Have to switch to your competitor ¯\()/¯ I am a very frequent user But I have the bug that lives for years The app constantly sends the driver to wrong side of the road And in Kyiv it often means extra 20 minutes wait Upsetting instability (The issue is not with GPS I manually select the right point This is the app bug),1
904,The past few weeks this app has become unbearable You have excessively increased prices when there are countless drivers literally within 2 minutes drive constantly crashing or causing issues between rider and drivers This was once a daily used app I will be going back to taxis and other apps Removing both uber and ubereats,1
905,Very appthis app dont find drivers quickly and because of this we always find trouble,3
906,Driver canceling the trip is very common If passenger cancels have to pay cancelation fee Drivers also need to make pay cancelation charges,1
907,When I have chosen PAYTM as payment mode my ride got cancelled 6 times and I had to wait for 1 hour and then I have used Ola to book a cab instead,1
908,RIP OFF PRICING Get quotes for $110 a ride when my friends are getting $33 for the same Route Can prove with screenshots CANT GET TRIPS FIXED Also they don’t let you dispute a lift Older than 30 days when I had been double charged and only just realised So they don’t chase it up or take responsibility at all Once 30 days is up and the Uber driver is paid too bad RUBBISH REWARDS I spend $150 a DAY on Uber Just to get 10% off all rides For 3 days How insulting,1
909,Worst experience of my life with this app I have booked 67 times a cab and every driver calls and ask for drop location then deny to drop and ask for cancel the trip so they could not be charged for that I hate it Would not recommend any one,1
910,The service is mostly good but the app has some bugs and some undesirable features Notifications cannot e turned off and are sometimes invasive and not related to a specific journey They cant be cancelled by swiping and require the app to be opened This shows terrible respect to customers In the app when booking future journeys the function for setting time is finicky Once a time is set it cant be changed without going back or off the app and starting again Frustrating,2
911,Worst app ever I have been using this app more than 2 years but recently facing so many issues The drivers keep cancelling trips  and for that they ask us to cancel the trip and we have to pay the fine Also if u dont close the app after the trip automatically you get booked with another trip No proper location access plus some drivers are rude Finally I have decided to leave uber and go for ola Congratulations on losing a customer for your pathetic services and drivers,1
912,Generally useful although in some cities drivers are not using Uber It would be useful to have an option to choose Whichever Uber is closest rather than have to try each option in turn to find a car less than 15 minutes away Now reduced to 2 :  Inability to pre order an Uber for the morning  Destination Error  Tried to book in the morning with no responses Canceled request and tried again but the price had DOUBLED and a driver well within the original search grid accepted,3
913,0 star Uber has lost its touch Really it no longer deserves good ratings I had credit Uber cash in my account after taking a ride I paid in cash but after checking my account extra cash was taken Recently when requesting for rides a driver will decline a ride when its literally 3 to 5 minutes away from picking me up Now you have to wait for another 10 to 15 minutes to request for another ride that wont bother accepting your request This is utterly unacceptable and infuriating,1
914,after booked the price was Rs 371 and and i got down 2 km before the destination charged 40750  very much disappointed Above is my old review And now 1 They can charge Any price as their wish 2 No customer support 3 After booking if the vehicle takes long time to reach and if you cancel you will be charged 4 No option to select good rated vehicle/ driver Again cancellation charges if you cancel the ride 5 As final view just ride at the given price in booked vehicle,1
915,Very good service with reasonable priceI am very happy Ola services are charging more price I priffer only Uber Thank you Uber,4
916,Not available on time most probably  most of the uberGO (not mini) are without ac In addition to above no luxury or sedan car option available at all,1
917,I dont know why google is deleting my review but once again There is not a option to talk to a support team from Uber to solve any issue All they have is a FAQ option,1
918,The drivers created a culture of canceling rides so often that estimate the time to get a ride has become a real issue Some times we cant even get a ride at all and we ended up needing to find another way to reach our destination Until this issue is addresaed there is no way to give Uber a good review,1
919,Uber please check on your drivers since 1 week every single driver is canceling the rides first they ask where you want to go then boom ride cancelled Ive got more cancelled rides then Ive travelled So frustrated It will be better if you guys remove the Uber auto coz you never get an auto,1
920,Extremely disappointed with the app when one needs to rush the cabs are 10mins latethen when one cancelled there is no way one can pay cash to the next driver Very poor service It happened with me on 171221 evening Had to cancel the cab as it was taking very long and one was late for a meeting The cancellation fees couldnt be paid in cash to the next driver Very poor app management,1
921,There is a scope for improvementmake it as user friendly as you canFor this sky is the limit,4
922,Blank screen after entering the 4 digit code Useless app Doesnt work at all,1
923,Pathetic service The cab drivers have a lot of time to chat and ask for the destination and if it is not convenient as per them they simply cancel the ride imagine if there is an urgency or emergency and we all know this isnt going to change Adding this review after experiencing the so called  Uber  Easy trips  few minutes back,1
924,Very poor services provided by the uber when you start booking ride with uber the driver keep cancelling the ride or if drive call you to ask the location and what is the mode of payment if you say online payment then driver immediately cancel the ride Bcoz of this you have to wait for 1 hr 2hrs or 3 hrs to get ride Thats why uber also not provided their number,1
925,This used to be a great app accessible reliable Lately fare increase due to the high demand is ridiculous and its active all the time If you find normal fare it cancels the trip says drivers are 20 min away or no drivers are available The cars available are a far cry from when uber started old and beat Drivers are nice but they dont seem to enjoy uber anymore either This the uber experience and is constantly trending due to ridiculous high prices Thats your research not a form,2
926,Im unhappy with this app and their services If someone wants to pay online then driver cancel the ride Driver asks pay through cash Then why the app has provide online method Literally 45 drivers cancel my ride everytime just because I have selected online method Also some uber driver give customer 1 ratings even customers are polite to them Im disappointed by this app,1
927,The drivers demands are really high Sometimes they doesnt work according to the app I mean they demand their own fares and sometimes run offline It get really tough when theres an emergency  one is running out of time But yes they always try to do their best and they also respond to peoples queries within 12mins So keeping aside the behaviour of some of the drivers overall its a good app,3
928,I can spend a long time swapping between drivers they sometimes accept the trips but they dont even have the intention to drive you anywhere And if you send them a message they read it and they completely ignored you and if I cancel the trip then I have to pay more money because of the driver time and effort thats nonsens,1
929,Extremely horrible experience The drivers keep cancelling Even in case of emergencies we have to call and beg them to not cancel There are very few drivers who genuinely accept the trip to transport the passenger and actually arrive and not pass it on others in the area I have to keep using this app out of necessity than my own liking There is no customer care number or email to contact Sometimes the driver force you to give cash and we are compeled to pay again on ap(faced this 2 times),1
930,The app keeps crashing Twice now when I make a booking and confirm the ride the app then crashes The full charges goes through my card but the ride is never booked Now I have to fight to get the charges reversed Very frustrating,1
931,Before this update I couldnt get signal through data (well below my cap) only WiFi Noticed theres an update available and now after the update it somewhat works Not sure if it glitches because of the signal or it was the app But what I didnt get was a notice or banner that I needed to update the app in order for it to work properly Had it not been for my doctors offices WiFi I would have felt stranded If this continues Ill switch to lyft,3
932,Earlier it was a good app for travel Now a days the drivers asks or calls to know your location and magically your ride gets cancelled time and again You are literally at the mercy of the drivers whim I will try not to use such useless app further,1
933,Useless app I booked a ride but instead of reaching the pickup point driver was roaming here and there Then almost after 2 hours of booking the ride a driver reached the pickup point They charged the bill from my account because finally after 2 hours their driver has bothered to reach the pickup point This app lacks basic feature of help on a ride They dont have any check and balance for their drivers,1
934,I dont have any problem with uber app Application is flawless but drivers are not accepting the orders and keep asking for destination and cancelling the ride makes experience annoying I think there is no issue with drivers as well as if they might be not getting enough share from from ride Uber you need to retrospect your commission policies,2
935,pathetic app I paid for the trip through Google pay but in receipt it says payment failed It happened twice in a single day I want receipt to show it to our company for reimbursement I even checked if I get penalty in the other ride but no And theres no customer care support searched all over the internet Plz I just want my receipt,1
936,Not a good experience Driver doesnt cancel the ride and doesnt come too I waited for atleast 15 minutes but he said that he is not coming At last had to cancel and had to pay 50 rs on my next trip Why cant they just put an option of driver denied duty like ola Why shud I waste my money like this,1
937,The cars are mostly very clean and drivers are usually pleasant However this company loves to gouge the prices Over the years they have increased the amount of fees included in the ride fare More often then not a ride that would usually cost anywhere from 1520 dollars will sometimes go as high as 48 dollars Will be boycotting from now on considering we as consumers now have plenty of better options when it comes to ride sharing apps,3
938,Last time I booked an car the driver accepted the request but he demanded extra payment before coming to my location I refused and asked to cancel so I can try another automatically by the app But he told me to cancel and a charges for my booking added to my next ride What a waste app Please instruct the drivers if willing to come accept elso dont We can try other options,1
939,One of the poorest customer services ever Contacted customer service after being overcharged (to do not mention robbed) while on a trip in South America as the final amount was completely a way higher than the estimated amount but Uber will not handled the case appropriately and will just send automated replies that will not match or answer the issues raised in my query Very unpleasant experience,1
940,After trip completion and complete payment done still it shows amt pending claimed by the driver Also no number available to contact support team,1
941,Worst app ever Cheaters I had to go somewhere and when the first time I saw the price it was fair enough And then in every 23 minutes the price stated increasing 1020% I thought there was a lot of traffic But when I used I friends phone it was still the same price and after 34 minutes the price in his app also started increasing I just want to ask one question: do you people do your business on peoples emergency,1
942,Unable to advance book a cab on this app And no Help  Support Also on July 20 night I tried booking a cab though the app and driver after driver just kept cancelling and the trip kept being rebooked with a new driver (who would again cancel) I lost I think 20 minutes because the app was not giving me the option to cancel the trip It was extremely irksome Also Uber drivers who keep refusing trips should be blacklisted because the whole point of Uber is to get a taxi whenever needed,1
943,Missing lots of critical features Fir example I book a ride request for tomorrow I get the confirmation email with the rider abd everything but theres now i can see or manage/cancel that ride inside the app Also I noticed that I have received rating but no way I can see who gave me this rating And may more things missing ,1
944,The app shows unrealistically high prices even for short distances Also the drivers give unfair ratings for VERY BIASED reasons I was once on an office call in the cab speaking in a low volume and the driver gave me a bad rating (I saw him tapping on one star while I was getting off) I have been using uber for 56 years and never have I had such an experience,1
945,Totally poor website I have charged double the company ask they would refund my amount for my first use but they didnt refund my big amount,1
946,The current driving experience is pathetic and extremely unreliable There is less drivers they do not accept the ride and if et al they do theyll take more time to reach and eventually you are forced to cancel the ride If the wait time is 10 mins you can expect to wait for least half an hour only to get your ride cancelled That is also youll get a cab only if you are lucky else youd wait 2030 mins to be lucky to get a cab Totally pathetic and unreliable now,1
947,Recently whenever I book a cabthe driver calls up and asks my location and then cancel the trip There has been a lot of inconvenience caused due to this Even there has been charges issue When the cab was booked for a location the amount which was shown the amount double of it I had to pay when I was dropped Please look into the matter because this causes a lot of inconvenience If this carries on then the trust for years on uber will go,1
948,I am very much disappointed with the uber services Most of the time there are no cars available and every time I book an uber (esoecially uber motos) the driver accepts the ride then calls and asks for the drop location and everytime when they dont feel like going to that location they cancel the ride Everytime this happens Uber should look into this matter with utter seriousness It is not at all a joke I face this problem almost every day,1
949,Since the upgrade to allow drivers to see where they are taking the passengers I have recieved alot of canceled rides from them and is unsafe for them to take forever to accept if I as a female need to ride to a place that doesnt suite them This has definitely made me less likely to choose Uber as my transportation,2
950,Very poor services as they are fraudtent in citylahore pak Most of times drives ids are different from the ids mentioned in the app Fares charges are mostly different and higher than the expected ones,1
951,The fare shows different before booking and later at the time of payment it is very high than expected For example today I booked an uber auto which showed ₹68 but at the time of payment it was showing ₹104 Wait time was only ₹3 This is not at all acceptable And this isnt the first time I am facing this issueCan you look into this,1
952,0 stars Worde experience ever Charged me 3 times before my ride showed up then tried to tell that was normal Would not answer my questions It took days to get my money back and 15 minutes before they were supposed to pick my kid up and bring him to the airport so he could come home for Xmas they messaged me and said no driver was available I ordered the ride 12 hours earlier Worst Service Ever Do not waste your time with this poor excuse for a company,1
953,The Uber Eats part of app lets you go through a whole order and then once adding in payment method or a voucher it gives an error message sorry no drivers available This message needs to be notified prior to completing an order Its very frustrating to convert vouchers to uber cash and then not be able to use them Uber for lifts works fairly well,2
954,Most of the times the driver will refuse to go to the location or ask for more money and refuses to cancel the ride as well And If i proceed to cancel then i end up getting charged Uber does absolutely nothing to fix this issue I end up feeling so helpless during these situations,1
955,07 January 2022 After booking a ride the app closes unexpectedly I am unable to track the cab Earlier review It is most userUNFRIENDLY Even after adding 2 cash less payment methods it does not allow me to book a ride unless I select cash payment option Still worse I am not allowed to delete both those methods too,1
956,Very unhappy with using Uber There is no convenience at all with regards yo customer service If were in trouble with the ride theres no one to contact at all for assistance I booked an Uber for an amount of 351 After booking and getting in touch with the driver i see that the amount increased by 100 that cane up to 450 hows that possible after seeing and booking my cab i get an increased amount by 100 The cancellation for this is 162 Why should i pay dis amount this isnt my fault,1
957,They double bill say its authorization charge and yet never return it Or they bill you for the ride your driver canceled 5 mins after booking and not showing ever Also no customer service line to dispute rides very Scam like and its a registered corporation Google my experiences as they are not isolated events,1
958,The app is okay but the drivers not so much Drivers keep accepting rides make you wait until they are nearby (5 to 20min wait) and then cancelling the ride This leaves a realy bad taste in my mouth whenever anyone mentiones Uber Please fire the drivers who does this If they can not accept the ride they shouldnt waste your time while you could have made alternate arrangements There seems to be no quality control of the drivers We should be able to rate the drivers who are time wasters,2
959,It doesnt work just at the time that i get a ride a system error pops up because i didnt pay Q5 for a trip cancellation i bet if i pay it now it will let me but i think its worthless in the first place I was told to cancel it and now im not able to use the app and there are other things but i wont mention it,1
960,Pathetic Service  though payed still shows not payed Unable book another cab and not even user friendly to reach customer care,1
961,Very pathetic experience This is my first experience I have scheduled an uber cab to catch the train at early in the morning The ride has started and ended without picking me up At that I had to search and book other cabs to catch the train Since then I stopped using Uber Today I have tried package delivery and this time also the same thing happend package has even not picked and delivered to me and the trip has been marked as completed The worst part is that we dont have proper complain,1
962,My partner was grabbed by a uber driver when she didnt give him cash Uber help line is a mess and formated against you speaking to one person so you have to go through the same problem again and again until you give up I was also told by uber the drivers account was deactivated until further notice and I could give them the crime number but was told 3 days later the driver is still in service They have zero intrested in keeping customers safe and make it difficult to speak to them,1
963,Poor app no pic up and high price I uninstall this app and requemend every person pic another app or public vehicle,1
964,Drivers dont show up after confirming rides and when asked to cancel the confimation they hang up the phone And I have to incur the charges of cancellation It didnt happen just once or twice but many a times Therefore Im uninstalling this app,1
965,This app was a great before But recently it has started taking 2 bookings for the same trip This leads to major confusions I have also experienced situations where even though the driver cancels the trip the cancellation charge will be applied to us That is seriously a bad experience,1
966,If I could I would give ZERO stars The second month in a row R9999 debited off my account with no permission what so ever When contacting uber on the first month I was told it was a promotion and that theres a chance my card number is on another phone The second month the person told me that it is apparently a subscription that I replied YES to but I hardly use uber where would I have accepted a subscription People please keep an eye out for this,1
967,First of all drivers cancel the trip at critical times or dont respond at all When you cancel cancellation charges are levied on you without any fault on your part Recently I had this worse experience I was charged a fare of Rs 243 for just 35 kms ride because Uber GPS was showing a different route Driver took an alternate route and dropped me after travelling a distance of 35 kms When I raised a complaint regarding this got a reply we will look in to it No resolution at all,1
968,The drivers dont come for pickup until we tell them the drop location and if they dont wish to take the trip they dont move at all And to top it off theres no way to contact Uber and put in a complaint The fares are unrealistically high and buying an uber pass was a waste of money The quality of service is degrading Please dont use this app Wish I could give it 0 stars,1
969,Dodgy App comes up with your ride fares then when you select a fare app straight away tells you that the price has expired and then the new price is almost double Sometimes closing the app and reopening it changes the price so this is not due to peak time changing prices I definitely got ripped off as my last trip cost more than a Taxi because the lower price expired within a minute of me opening the app apparently and the new price was almost double Be warned when using Uber,2
970,Used to be fine now cannot add family gets stuck on payment even if you load different cards,2
971,Worse than phoning for a mini cab and much worse than black cabs in London Marginally cheaper but this doesnt make up for the wait and confusing options,2
972,When you match with a driver they first ask you how much the fare is if it is low they ask you to cancel and there is no way to complain for such drivers Moreover we have to pay cancellation when its not even our fault Seriously disappointed,1
973,When booking thru this app it shows 5 min after driver accepts After 1 or 2 minutes u will see no movement of vehicle for long time even after 10 min But the vehicle will be nearer Then when u call the driver he wil demand for extra money If u cancel u lose 10 to 30 Rs Once one driver cancel it keeps on searching other vehicle At that time no cancel option This is the third time for me When i spoke to one of the driver said what uber is paying us is very less 30% uber takes,1
974,Worst experience with the Driver partners And worst experience with getting in touch with the customer service as wellI had taken a trip last month and paid 316 to driver in cashand the driver told me if it shows pending online he will reverse it backbut nothing happenedit still shows pending amount and i am not able to make any bookingswhy should i pay twice when i already paid through gpay to the driver unfortunately have to say that it a pathetic service and experience,1
975,They always have a technical problem when it comes to refunds but never when it comes to reserving the trip charge I wouldnt advise anyone to use it as the support team cant help you at all they literally send you one message a day and everyone sends the same automated response Bad service delivery everytime,1
976,Drivers are cancelling the drive after accepting and making us wait for 1012 mins Today two drivers did the same Asking drop location and cancelling the ride has become the trend now Though I have reported the issue there was no response from your side I am thinking seriously to uninstall the app now Ridiculous behavior of drivers,1
977,Ubers cab driver waiting me for 50 to 55 minutes (1) he book me and after 8 to 9 minutes he cancelled tripp (2) after another cab book me he also takes 5 to 7 minutes and cancelled(3) after another person says you have to pay toll charges because he is coming from mira road and he says it takes 25 to 30 minutes to come i want to go dahisar E to borivali E railway station there is no toll gate between my residence to borivali He also cancelled (4) person call me and says im comming,1
978,Disgusting service On my previous trip the driver refused card payment so had to pay cash Uber did not have it updated and on my current trip got forced to pay the previous trip fare once again plus my current trip fare Tweeted helplessly complained in the apponly to get INR 150 uber credits only How unfair is that Horrible service no customer care one can reach out to unprofessional driversthe list goes on If the concerned authoritiesre watching thispls look into the matter,1
979,I was disappointed to find out that I could not plan anymore than 4 routes without the trip ending I think the feature for more stops should be added asap Cause now Im stuck far from home and I had to walk 8km cause I tried doing it all in one trip which seems to be a limitation at least from my experience It needs to be more easy and intuitive to contact uber drivers if you left something in their car aka my $2000 samsung s21 Im not saying the app is bad but changes need to be ma,2
980,Very unsatisfied by your app because when i the cab it was showing that it will reach in 20 min and after waiting for an hour the cab still did not come Also in the app the cab was not movingAnd finally i had to cancel and it says you have to pay a penalty Your app sucks and we are going to pay thats not fair🤬🤬🤬🤬kindly remove this bug of your app else others have to face problems like me,1
981,Vey bad service and overpriced  my account was hacked and I had to make another account because that problem was never solved also the drivers are awful in their services most of them,1
982,Such pathetic inapp experience Gives no value to customers and the only thing is that They keep on cancelling the rides if we say no for the fare theyre demanding to The last time when I didnt pay 800/ where the actual fare was 194/ I got blocked out Uber am very much disappointed for your customer service where its nothing by the way If this continues it may lead to a great downfall for your app I suggest you to refresh your drivers,1
983,Ive been standing here for 30 mins now trusted this app and let my friend go home without me Biggest mistake of my life It says I have a ride but on homepage I dont but theres a scheduled ride in your bookings which I cant see the OTP of Its been so long Ive been standing here waiting for the driver and this is not the first time this is happening This app is just straight bad and not worth it lol Cant ever use this again,1
984,This app used to be useful earlier But now its a complete mess Driver doesnt come for pickup They just text they have arrived and ask for phone number After which we receive otp and then ride starts as somehow driver is able to entre correct otp by himself And then they end this trip It just wastes our time If you are more than 5 minutes away from driver he will not come and just follow the above mentioned process please check how can driver entre correct otp when we didnt tell,1
985,I use uber about twice a week Today there were no cars around and the car that was sent would take longer than going on foot I cancelled the trip right away and still had to pay the full amount Thats called stealing guys 02/02/22: Tried again took the same waiting time as my train Hmm Thats not good,1
986,Since the last few rides drivers have been taking longer routes and fares are increasing even doubling They show a different rate and one has to pay entirely something else Im in a ride that took the Noida route that Im sure would force me to pay extra FIX THIS,2
987,Giving 1 star since you guys dont give option for negative ratings Waiting for the last 45 mins and at least 7 to 8 drivers canceled the booking Drivers dont even bother to receive calls Thank you for such a wonderful service This is the last time using UBER Thank you for getting me late PATHETIC,1
988,Inform your drivers about the mode of paymenthad a lot of argument with the driverthey always want them to pay offline even if i paid online And as an agent you dont even careworst maintanenceand this is my last ride with this stupid app,1
989,I am having a hell of an experience nowadays with uber drivers They demand for extra amount than whatever is shown on the app They decline the ride if i have put up an online payment especially card Can you believe how much time i get lost finding a ride And this happens in the most critical situations where i need a ride badly If drivers charges on his own will then why should i use this app Truly disappointed Whats the use of complaining after a ride I did a lot Nobody cared,1
990,This is a very unreliable service Not only did Uber had taken money from me even before fidning a driver then when I found one he deleted the call after I waited for him for the due time (20 minutes) Then I lost another half an hour waiting for Uber to find another driver (obviously they took some money again form my credit card) Obviously they gave me my money back but I lost a lot of time Quite expensive and extremely unprofessional and unreliable,1
991,Horrific Experience with App It frose after booking and I couldnt contact with driver Finally driver could contact me after 4 attempts App didnt show that cab is booked and I had my flight so it had taken 20 minutes fir the booked cab to appear Update on 03/01/2022 same thing happened again The problem is you cant complain anywhere about this app issue,1
992,I selected google pay in last trip but your driver was not having google pay so i paid in cash but now as i am checking in app it shows unpaid trip check with your driver and update in app as well otherwise service was good Get it clerify and update my payment status as paid No one cares about customer feedback my last ride is still showing unpaid even after paying in cash to driver,1
993,Im booking Uber daily twice or thrice Regular customer of Uber 1/4 of my salary goes to Uber On Friday Dec 10 was the third time I booked to DCF Waiting time was showing 3min 2min The route kept changing It took almost 15 min to come even though it was very near I took screenshots and reported The answer was that if waiting time is 10 min or mire I can cancel When waiting time for me was showing all the time 3min 2min Uber lost regular customer and Ill rate everyday 1 star only,1
994,Something is seriously wrong in your app It never picks up the correct pickup location by any means Please do something about it I need to always call the driver to come to my house for picking me as the vehicle always waits elsewhere and each of the driver always says they are at the correct pickup location Btw I do not face such issue with other apps like OLA for example,1
995,Drivers take advantage of the app to get passengers and when they arrive on location they force the passenger to cancel the uber ride and go with an offline ride instead for the same price And if you ask them beforehand about this issue they usually ask you the customer to cancel so the drivers dont have to pay the cancellation fee Please fix this system,1
996,The app will ditch u on the last moment My mother had to be urgently rushed to the dentist and the cab drivers were busy playing pass to other drivers They refused to answer call and have utter disregard for both the company and the customer This not the dirst instance but many in the lasr 2 months Uber rides are nowadays easy and convenient to the drivers and at their prices Riders/customers is all a farce,2
997,I tried to book ride last 1 hr but always show vehicle is no longer available but on map show there 3 vehicle,1
998,Can be useful Can also be terribly useless Ive wasted money on trips Ive wanted to make but the app is stuck in a loop looking for a driver and I have to order the same trip again and pay again for it only to find a driver immediately,1
999,Always cancelling short trips Uber is so bad nowadays Drivers are always cancelling short trips or because theres traffic on the highway I have to wait over 3040 minutes for a ride in the city center Awful,1
