Version 22.02.10.0 (Feb 13, 2022)
Bug Fixes
• Fixed: When attempting to edit your profile, the keyboard was obscuring the text entry field, with no way to scroll down and see your edits. We’d like to say that this is the sort of challenge that ultimately builds character, but instead we’ll say it was a bug which ultimately was just a pain.
Version 22.01.30.0 (Jan 30, 2022)
What’s New
• Prefer for tappable URLs to be underlined? We’ve added a new Accessibility option to the Preferences menu to increase visibility for those words that are, in fact, links.
Bug Fixes
• Long-pressing on a URL would bring up a menu with several prompts, none of which would actually do anything. We’d call it a false dilemma, but that would imply that any of the choices you were given were real options.
Version 22.01.20.0-externalflavor (Jan 17, 2022)
Bug Fixes
• Fixed: If you opened the DMs tab and repeatedly scrolled up and down, you may have noticed that the preview text would slowly be replaced by multiple copies of the word “You.” It would seem our “New Year, New You” initiative had gotten a bit out of hand.
Version 22.01.11.0-externalflavor (Jan 6, 2022)
Bug Fixes
• We tweaked some things too small to notice or too difficult to explain. We’ll return you to your regular, more interesting types of release next time (we hope).
Version 22.01.10.0-externalflavor (Jan 2, 2022)
Bug Fixes
• Fixed: If you manually marked a message as unread, you may have found the app took your instructions to heart with such conviction and intensity that the message could then never be marked as read. Time softens our most rigid postures (a code change doesn’t hurt either), so you should find message read states are now more appropriately fluid.
Version 21.12.10.0 (Dec 5, 2021)
What’s New
• No news is good news! Well, some news can also be good news, or no news could perhaps lead to uncertainty and speculation on par with bad news, but in this case our absence of news is a good thing. Or at least not a bad thing. No news is just fine. Carry on.
Version 21.11.20.0 (Nov 15, 2021)
What’s New
• The channel list just got easier to command! Tap and hold on any channel or DM in the Home tab to mark a conversation as read, mute notifications, copy the channel name or leave it entirely. All this with the press of a finger.
Version 21.11.10.0 (Oct 31, 2021)
Bug Fixes
• If you’re someone who sets their screen zoom and font size to the maximum values, you may have noticed that the text editing field was getting pushed offscreen. We want there to be room for everyone in the app, so you should find the editor now remains in view no matter how much you “enhance” the image. 🔬
Version 21.10.20.0 (Oct 17, 2021)
What’s New
• New emoji reactions will now appear immediately while in the All Threads view, because it’s exhausting switching back and forth just to see if people laughed at your Squid Game jokes.
• If you’re using Slack Connect to share a private channel with another organization, we’ll make sure it stays private on the receiving end. That is, there is no option when accepting a private shared channel to make it public. More peace of mind for you, more security for all.
Version 21.10.10.0 (Oct 3, 2021)
What’s New
• You can now record video and audio clips right within Slack. Add some face time to your team updates, talk through feedback, or just say hello. Want to sing your portion of the stand-up? Best check with your manager on that one.
• The channel list just got a little friendlier. You’ll now see avatars next to your Direct Messages, and for those group conversations with lots of names, we’ve given you a bit more space to see just who it is you’re talking to.
Version 21.09.20.0 (Sep 20, 2021)
What’s New
• Minor improvements have been made, and bug fixes taken place, but they’re the kind that are out of sight, behind closed doors, and quietly just doing their job, deep in the inner workings of the app, making things just a little bit better.
Version 21.09.10.0 (Sep 6, 2021)
Bug Fixes
• Fixed: Tapping the search option on the Android keyboard while an active search was already underway created a feedback loop of meta-searches, eventually concluding in a crash. Turns out the app didn’t like being faced with the existential crisis of having a search within a search. A question within a question. A void within a void. Where were we?
Version 2021.08.23 (Aug 22, 2021)
What’s New
• This will be the last version of Slack that supports Android 6 and 7. In addition, starting on September 1st, you’ll need to be running Android 8 or later in order to connect to Slack. We know this is potentially frustrating news, but these minimum requirements are necessary in order to ensure Slack remains as secure and seamless as we built it to be. Thank you for your understanding.
Version 2021.08.09 (Aug 8, 2021)
What’s New
• We’ve made it much quicker to join Slack from a Shared Connect invite, because never does time move as slowly as when you are filling out forms in the shadow of the place you really want to be. Come on in; the channel’s fine.
Bug Fixes
• Fixed: You can now set a reminder for a “custom” time of your choosing. You always should have been able to, but our system got a little restrictive there for a minute. Want that “Make a wish” message to remind you at 11:11? The app is your oyster.
Version 2021.07.26 (Jul 25, 2021)
Bug Fixes
• Fixed: Custom skin tones were not being respected in reacji, giving you the generic yellow version instead. Going forward, the emoji you choose will now be the emoji that's shared.
• Fixed: If you start a new message with a ‘>’ symbol, the message will be formatted as a block quote, just like it would be on our other platforms. You can (block) quote us on that.
Version 2021.07.12 (Jul 11, 2021)
Bug Fixes
• Fixed: Links were not opening when Slack’s preferences were set to hand off to an external browser app, instead providing a vague and unsatisfying error message. This has been fixed, and the only thing vague and unsatisfying now is the ending to that screenplay we’ve been working on.
Version 2021.06.28 (Jun 27, 2021)
Bug Fixes
• Fixed: Links were not opening when Slack’s preferences were set to hand off to an external browser app, instead providing a vague and unsatisfying error message. This has been fixed, and the only thing vague and unsatisfying now is the ending to that screenplay we’ve been working on.
Version 2021.06.14 (Jun 13, 2021)
Bug Fixes
• Fixed: If you had your settings such that images would not be automatically expanded, our “tap to expand this image” prompt would get mixed up with any text previews generated from a posted URL, leading to similar amounts of confusion as experienced when describing this bug.
• Fixed: If a direct message from a bot contained buttons, and you tapped the message to view its details, the buttons would no longer work. Broken buttons beget bitterness, but better buttons bring bliss.
Version 2021.06.01 (May 31, 2021)
What’s New
• Did you know you can tap and hold on an emoji reaction to see who reacted to the message? Well if you didn’t, now you do. And if you already knew about that, go ahead and give it another go. We’ve made it dramatically easier to see who’s reacted to what. How dramatically? Eight years of theater school and a summer production of Hamlet.
Version 2021.05.17 (May 16, 2021)
Bug Fixes
• Fixed: Long-pressing on the app icon to jump to a recent DM now actually takes you to that DM. We thought it would be better if our buttons actually did the thing we told you they would do.
Version 2021.05.03 (May 2, 2021)
What’s New
• If you’re well versed in Simplified or Traditional Chinese — or aspire to be one day — you can now use Slack in those languages. Set your language preferences in You > Preferences > Language & region.
Version 2021.04.19 (Apr 18, 2021)
What’s New
• An emoji is worth a thousand words, and now you’ll be able to access them more easily: both the picker and search are now in the bottom sheet, and you’ll see more of them at a glance.
Bug Fixes
• Fixed: A pesky bug that used to show an incorrect number of reactions in the Mentions & Reactions tab (or worse yet, didn’t show the reaction at all) has been dutifully squashed. Or collected and gently put outside. Either way, it’s gone.
Version 2021.04.05 (Apr 4, 2021)
Bug Fixes
• Fixed: Marking a reminder as complete should give you a deep and profound sense of satisfaction, not an error message. Those errors are gone now, so you can keep blazing through your to-do list.
• Fixed: While you were crafting the perfect message, the slightest tap outside the keyboard would take you to a different place entirely. Now, we keep you where you are until you’re ready to leave.
Version 2021.03.22 (Mar 21, 2021)
Bug Fixes
• Fixed: Group DMs were difficult to distinguish because the app would truncate the list of participants. Now it’s easier to see names when composing a message or looking in the quick switcher. You’ll know the names of everyone at the party before you walk into the room.
Version 2021.03.09 (Mar 8, 2021)
What’s New
• Fans of the workspace switcher, take note: First of all, we are flattered you consider yourself a fan of the workspace switcher. Chuffed, even. Second, we’re giving it a refresh, so you can better distinguish your workspaces and switch between them more easily.
• For some, search is the heart of Slack. Now, it’s also the feet, because search is moving to its own tab at the bottom of the app.
Version 2021.02.23 (Feb 22, 2021)
Bug Fixes
• Fixed: Tapping a profile picture or username in a thread used to do nothing. We weren’t ignoring you; we’re just really into this show at the moment. Tapping a profile picture or username now opens that person’s profile.
Version 2021.02.08 (Feb 7, 2021)
Bug Fixes
• Fixed: An obscure, odd, out-of-left-field crash. If you’ve ever tried editing your profile while also rotating your phone, you may have seen this crash. Now, you won’t.
Version 2021.01.25 (Jan 24, 2021)
Bug Fixes
• We tuned up the engine and gave the interiors a thorough clean. Everything is now running smoothly again.
Version 2021.01.21 (Jan 20, 2021)
Bug Fixes
• We tuned up the engine and gave the interiors a thorough clean. Everything is now running smoothly again.
Version 2021.01.11 (Jan 10, 2021)
What’s New
• Previously, the keyboard would appear and disappear in a way that felt inelegant — or even choppy. We’re happy to report that the appearance and disappearance of keyboards has been smoothed out for Android 11 and newer.
Version 2020.12.14 (Dec 13, 2020)
What’s New
• Noble adventurer, your “slash command” skill has been upgraded. You now have access to the /expand and /collapse commands, and the power to expand or collapse inline images and video courses through your veins.
Bug Fixes
• Fixed: On phones with a “notch” (you’ll know it if you’ve got it), some content was hidden beneath the notch when viewing images full screen. Slack is now aware of — and respects — the notch.
Version 2020.11.30 (Nov 29, 2020)
What’s New
• Fixed: Adding a new line to a block quote or code block used to make Slack crash. That was then. Now, we won’t be blocking you from building your blocks however you’d like.
Version 2020.11.09 (Nov 8, 2020)
What’s New
• We do these releases every week to keep on top of performance… but sometimes there's nothing specific to tell you. So let's talk about some things we should have been better about telling you about in the first place. Like, did you know that you can long press on a message on mobile to set it to "unread", so it's there waiting for you when you get to your desk? Or set a reminder to look at it later? Oh, you did? Never mind, then. Carry on.
Version 2020.10.26 (Oct 25, 2020)
What’s New
• Slack is now available in Korean, which means you can finally DM your favorite BTS member! That was a joke, please do not do that.
Bug Fixes
• Time may be a construct, but you shouldn’t have to do math to know what hour it is. Now, we match your device's preferences when we display times. If you use a 24-hour clock, you’ll see it reflected when you set a custom status that expires or when you snooze a notification.
Version 2020.10.19 (Oct 18, 2020)
What’s New
• Maybe you’ve heard of Slack Connect, which reduces countless back-and-forth emails by letting you add partners, clients or vendors to a channel. Now, if your organization allows it, you can add another company to a new channel straightaway in the mobile app.
Version 2020.09.28 (Sep 27, 2020)
What’s New
• Bugs were squished, performance was improved, work was done, and the result was good. Please enjoy Slack responsibly.
Version 2020.09.14 (Sep 13, 2020)
What’s New
• Sometimes, we make improvements that are important, but invisible. This is one of those times. You shouldn’t notice anything different, and that’s the idea — Slack should just keep working like you expect it to.
Version 2020.08.31 (Aug 30, 2020)
What’s New
• Sometimes we release a new version of our app with improvements and bug fixes so intricate and unseen they can’t be conveyed by a collection of words. So instead of something new, and speaking of collections of words… have you tried keyword notifications — a nifty way to stay tuned in to topics you care about? Set or see your keywords by tapping You > Settings > My keywords. They’re very good.
Version 2020.08.14 (Aug 13, 2020)
What’s New
• New: For something you’ve read but need to come back to later, you can now mark a thread as unread. Long-press on the message you’d like to start from, and then select the option to mark unread from the menu. Yes, you’ve been able to do it with channel messages for a long time, but now, you can do it in threads too. Useful!
Version 2020.08.03 (Aug 2, 2020)
Bug Fixes
• Fixed: A few people noticed that you could select “Also send to channel” by tapping the blank space next to the checkbox in a threaded reply. We’ve tightened up that space so your replies only appear outside the thread when you want them to.
Version 2020.07.20 (Jul 19, 2020)
What’s New
• You can now customize your notification preferences on a per-day basis, which is a fancy way of saying that you can now pause interruptions with Do Not Disturb down to the day. (Looking for a feature to pause interruptions from pets, kids, or package deliveries? We feel you.)
Version 2020.07.09 (Jul 8, 2020)
What’s New
• You can now customize your notification preferences on a per-day basis, which is a fancy way of saying that you can now pause interruptions with Do Not Disturb down to the day. (Looking for a feature to pause interruptions from pets, kids, or package deliveries? We feel you.)
Version 20.06.20.0 (Jun 23, 2020)
What’s New
• This is the last version of Slack that will work on Android 5.0. To get updates in the future, you’ll need to update your device to Android 6.0 (or newer).
Bug Fixes
• Fixed: If you drafted a reply to a thread, and then that thread was deleted, you were unable to open the draft you’d drafted. This was bad, but now it’s better: you can open, copy, and delete those drafts.
Version 20.06.10.0 (Jun 10, 2020)
Bug Fixes
• Fixed: When viewing the channel list, the ‘+’ buttons that let you browse channels or start a new direct message sometimes, well, didn’t. Now they do, every time.
Version 20.05.21.0 (Jun 2, 2020)
Bug Fixes
• We’ve tinkered with the internal workings and polished some rough edges. The app is now better than it was.
Version 20.05.20.0 (May 31, 2020)
Beta testers, like you, are the best. As ever, thank you, and let us know if you find anything askew. Actual release notes coming soon!
Version 20.05.10.0. (May 12, 2020)
TL;DR: We’ve redesigned the layout of the app. Read more about the improvements on our blog at SlackHQ.com or in our help center. Here though, we’ll stick to what’s new, and what has been fixed.
Version 20.04.20.0. (Apr 28, 2020)
Bug Fixes
• Fixed: On some devices, the text input area sometimes wouldn’t be visible after changing channels. It hadn’t disappeared, it had just scrolled off the bottom of the screen. Cheeky. It is now once again possible to send messages without playing hide and seek with the message box.
Version 20.04.10.0 (Apr 14, 2020)
Bug Fixes
• Fixed: Some users who are required to use a passcode when accessing Slack were experiencing a crash when entering that passcode. Entering the passcode will now cause you to experience the app. Which, we hope, is better.
Version 20.03.30.0 (Mar 31, 2020)
What’s New
• Minor improvements have been made, and bug fixes taken place, but they’re the kind that are out of sight, behind closed doors, and quietly just doing their job, deep in the inner workings of the app, making things just a little bit better.
Version 20.03.20.0 (Mar 23, 2020)
What’s New
• While you might not be able to see anything changed, we’ve been hard at work keeping things ticking over. It’s all going great.
Version 2020.03.17 (Mar 16, 2020)
What’s New
• While you might not be able to see anything changed, we’ve been hard at work keeping things ticking over. It’s all going great.
Version 2020.03.16 (Mar 15, 2020)
What’s New
• What’s new? Nothing and everything. Or rather, it’s an update that makes things better, but is all invisible to the human eye or not something you could, as a user, put your finger on. Literally. So, in other words: “Bug fixes and Minor Improvements”.
Version 2020.03.04 (Mar 3, 2020)

Version 2020.03.02 (Mar 1, 2020)
What’s New
• The Android app has been looking after itself to bring in the new year, and as a result, it’s now a smaller download, with faster performance to boot.
Version 2020.02.20 (Feb 19, 2020)
What’s New

Version 2020.02.18 (Feb 17, 2020)
Bug Fixes
• Fixed: People who use Chrome OS and an external keyboard were finding that some messages would post twice if they used the enter button on the keyboard. It will now return to the amount of times you wanted that message sent (assuming that amount was “once”).
Version 2020.02.11 (Feb 10, 2020)
Bug Fixes

Version 2020.02.10 (Feb 9, 2020)
What’s New
• We’ve been working hard behind the scenes to make sure everything is polished, well-oiled, and running as it should be. If you notice anything to the contrary, as always, let us know!
Version 2020.02.06 (Feb 5, 2020)
What’s New
• We’ve been working hard behind the scenes to make sure everything is polished, well-oiled, and running as it should be. If you notice anything to the contrary, as always, let us know!

Version 2020.01.21 (Jan 20, 2020)
Bug Fixes
• Fixed: In a message from a bot, buttons and menus configured to respond to a user’s actions weren’t actually doing that. This was not the first stage in a robot uprising: it was merely a bug. And is no more.
Version 2020.01.08 (Jan 7, 2020)
Bug Fixes

Version 2020.01.06 (Jan 5, 2020)
What’s New
• For those who love to format their messages on the move, good news, you can now get that done in a few clicks using the new formatting tool in the message field.
Bug Fixes
• If, by some chance, you rotated your device immediately after sending a message, a copy of that message would sometimes remain in the input field (as well as being sent). Why? Who knows! Technology is weird. But at least it’s now weird and fixed.
Version 2019.12.11 (Dec 10, 2019)
What’s New

Version 2019.12.09 (Dec 8, 2019)
Bug Fixes
• Fixed: Sending the /rename command to rename a channel without any other text no longer causes a crash. The /crash command, meanwhile, is still not working at all, so if you were using /rename to get that effect, apologies for the inconvenience to your workflow.
Version 2019.11.20 (Nov 19, 2019)
Bug Fixes

Version 2019.11.18 (Nov 17, 2019)
What’s New
Nothing to see here… just plenty of tinkering behind the scenes to make room for other features (and bugs, of course) to come.
Version 2019.11.06 (Nov 5, 2019)
What’s New

Version 2019.11.04 (Nov 3, 2019)
Bug Fixes
• Fixed: The “Aubergine Classic” theme was using the color scheme for the new, (perhaps future-classic) Aubergine theme. We have reverted to classic-classic.
• Fixed: Sometimes, when we tried to show a long message in a dialog window, it would show a blank window instead, which is basically the opposite. Sometimes things are said best when one says nothing at all. This, however, was not one of those times. So we fixed it.
Version 2019.10.23 (Oct 22, 2019)

Version 2019.10.21 (Oct 20, 2019)
Bug Fixes
• We tweaked some things too small to notice or too difficult to explain. We’ll return you to your regular, more interesting types of release next time (we hope).
Version 2019.10.11 (Oct 10, 2019)
Bug Fixes
• We tweaked some things too small to notice or too difficult to explain. We’ll return you to your regular, more interesting types of release next time (we hope).
Version 2019.10.09 (Oct 8, 2019)
What's New
• All default sidebar themes are now also supported in dark mode — so when you shift into dark mode, whichever of our default themes you use will subtly shift to complement it.
• In accordance with the unstoppable march of time, updates will only be available to devices running Android 5.0 (aka Lollipop) or later.
Version 2019.09.23 (Sep 25, 2019)
Bug Fixes
• Fixed: In the Threads screen, after removing a reaction, it was not possible to add other reactions. Changing your mind, or your emoji, is your prerogative, and you are now once again free to indulge that.
Version 19.09.20.0 (Sep 24, 2019)
Bug Fixes
• Fixed: In the Threads screen, after removing a reaction, it was not possible to add other reactions. Changing your mind, or your emoji, is your prerogative, and you are now once again free to indulge that.
Version 19.09.10.0 (Sep 10, 2019)
Bug Fixes
• Fixed: Sometimes, if you checked the box in a thread to post your reply in channel as well, the reply would look like it had been sent twice in the thread… until you closed the thread and reopened it. It only ever posted once, but now it looks that way too. Apologies for the confusion.
Version 19.08.20.0 (Aug 27, 2019)
Bug Fixes
• Fixed: A crash that sometimes occurred after sending a message while offline, and then coming back online no longer occurs. The app stays up, and the message is sent. Everyone wins.
• Fixed: For those using Slack in UK English, the “Join Channel” button displayed at the bottom of a channel you had not yet joined was reading “Join %1$s”. It has been pointed out to us that this is not how the British spell “channel”, so we changed it. Awfully sorry about that.
Version 19.08.10.0 (Aug 20, 2019)
Bug Fixes
• Fixed: Sometimes outgoing messages to a channel looked like they had been sent twice.
Version 19.07.31.0 (Aug 6, 2019)
Bug Fixes
• We tuned up the engine and gave the interiors a thorough clean. Everything is now running smoothly again.
Version 19.07.30.0 (Jul 30, 2019)
Bug Fixes
• Fixed: The buttons that appeared after @-mentioning a user in a channel (“Invite to a channel” and “Share a link”) not performing those actions, which was illogical. If you experienced this and questioned whether you'd ever pushed the button at all, it wasn't you being delusional, it was us being irrational. It is now fixed.
Version 19.07.20.0 (Jul 16, 2019)
We tweaked some things too small to notice or too difficult to explain. We’ll return you to your regular, more interesting types of release next time (we hope).

Bug Fixes
• Fixed: When long pressing on a message to perform an action — like marking unread, setting a reminder or sharing — some of the message actions were overlapping unattractively. They're much more attractive now.
Version 2019.05.06 (May 5, 2019)
What’s New
• Support for Google Smart Lock has been added, so if you’ve enabled Google Smart Lock on your device, you can now log into Slack with one single glorious tap.
Version 2019.04.24 (Apr 23, 2019)
What’s New

• Clicking the + button at the top of your list of channels always got you to a Channel Browser (true!) but that channel browser has been improved in lots of little ways. The fact it will now indicate which channels you're a member of is but one. Click it to find the others.

• Your latest unread channels should now highlight and get sorted to the top of your sidebar faster than before. Zippy!
Bug Fixes
• Fixed: Externally-hosted files (like those hosted on Google Drive, for instance) were showing download button that looked great, but didn't actually work. Now it looks great, also works, and everything opens as it used to.

What’s New
• A small detail for the eagle-eyed: We've changed the way we number our releases. The last one was 2.76.1, this one is 19.2.1. Most people won't notice, but we wanted to make sure you knew you hadn't missed anything. Carry on.
Bug Fixes
• Fixed: @-mentions and block quotes were sometimes showing up in weird colors and sometimes not displaying at all. This simply wasn't cricket, so we fixed it.

What’s New
• Fixed: Custom emojis that did not start off as perfect squares were appearing squished or stretched, and that simply wouldn't do. Our myriad apologies for this terrible state of affairs. It is now remedied.
Version 2019.01.07 (Jan 6, 2019)
What’s New

And we’ve also added two new presets to our existing list: “Until tomorrow” and “Until next week”. A veritable panoply of new options for pausing notifications! Or, at the very least, "several"!

• You can now receive notifications while using the app, so If you're catching up on a channel and you receive a DM you won't miss it (and if that doesn't sound like something you'd want, you'll find this in the notification settings menu).

What’s New
• Fixed: After ending a Slack call, the call sometimes appeared to be ongoing in the notifications tray. It wasn't (ongoing) but the fact that it was (in the notifications tray) meant a new call couldn't be started. Apologies for this, it's all better now.

What’s New
• Nothing lasts forever. Now when you set your status, you can also set a time (or date) for that status to expire. No longer will people question how you're "Working remotely on Tuesday" when it's Thursday, or wonder why you've been "At the dentist" for 19 consecutive hours.

What’s New
• Message actions come to Android: It's now easier to create tasks, comment on tickets, or follow-up on things while on the move. So if you have important tools like Asana, Zendesk and Jira connected to Slack, you can now long press any message and create a follow up without needing to log into those tools. It's very good. We recommend it.

What’s New
• The issue of unruly App Shortcut shapes has been resolved. When you create an App shortcut, the icon will now match the shape of the other icons on your home screen, a feature, we understand, that has been much desired by a user called Ian. So Ian: this one's for you.
Bug Fixes

What’s New
• Threads now support files — and files support threads. Images and files can be uploaded directly to threads — you can do it by adding files as you normally would. When you comment on a file or an image, it is stored as thread reply. Just like message threads, your replies will now stay nested in a thread attached to the file.

What's New:
• Fixed: Tapping the share button very rapidly over and over again could lead to a loop where the file would get shared over and over again too (until the app was force-quit, or, let's face it, rage-quit). An air of calm now pervades.
• Fixed: The application of logic and fine engineering now mean that downloading a file containing the ‘%’ character in the filename will no longer cause a crash.

• Fixed: When team preference for allowing anyone to use @here and @channel is switched off, we no longer, logically, allow the user to send messages or comments including @here.
