0,Absolutely terrible experience ordering dinner for the family Placed an order for pizza  wings  the Uber App said that driver (name not disclosed) would pick up  deliver it It gave me the update that they were waiting for it Then 40 minutes later when they should have taken it the app says a new driver is responsible for my meal order for I called the guy  he said that the other guy had already picked up the order No delivery 10 min later I get left in the dust  no recourse,0.31252294708600525,0.010220368771993733,0.6772566841420011
1,Unreliable Drivers cancel constantly and half the time theyre 20 minutes away despite the supposed 3 minutes away For the prices you pay youd think theyd be better Been late to work due to last minute (literally) cancelations Today a driver canceled the trip when she arrived AT my house How does that make sense Shouldve been on time Now Im in a new uber texting my manager an explanation as to how in the world I left the house early to still arrive late Thanks Uber,0.00852569143364737,0.5998044511974266,0.39166985736892596
2,Not woth it The price keeps rising The trip prices are inconsistent A trip that would usually cost me $20 just rose to $72 out of nowhere This isnt the first time its happened Fix this issue 12/12/21 Now it just sticks with the higher price no matter how long I wait 12/20/21 Now they drastically increased the uber rewards cost Now I have pay more points to get a discount The price of rides also increased permanently 2/23/22 price for a $20 trip is now $25 no matter the wait or reward,0.0076794826344999765,0.6005266075470668,0.39179390981843315
3,This app is absolutely ATROCIOUS The amount of headaches Ive gained and money Ive lost in just a couple of months while trying to buy a car is stunning They claim you can cancel your ride but they do a good job hiding the feature in hopes that you wont figure it out in time and they can take your money Everything about the app is so counter intuitive Its as if their primary goal is frustrating their customers I am so pissed that I have given these people money I hope they go bankrupt,0.7173162216044358,0.2707624527683287,0.011921325627235614
4,This is an extremely expensive service app with freeapplevel customer service I actually dont mind the fees but the service is completely unacceptable for the rates charged for things like service It doesnt cost $5 to run a computer system for customer service on every order Like I said Ill pay your fees but I will not accept a total lack of customer service with a premium app,0.010655154232134052,0.25618515926346985,0.733159686504396
5,Wouldnt recommend it to anyone unless they are REALLY desperate This is because: 1 The navigator takes the drivers to the back of the destinations which are sometimes very dangerous alleys 2 If I direct the driver to the correct street the app wont allow them to log their trip to complete it 3 It never takes me straight home but asks the driver to drive by only to make them make a uturn back to the spot they drove by 4 A none smoking driver option should be added for health reaso,0.4698753707025158,0.5189261046697483,0.01119852462773595
6,Seriously uber has became unreliable So unreliable I bought my own car Literally ridiculous now No one should be 50 minutes late when they schedule a half hour before arriving Half the drivers dont even move from their spot and wont message back Some drive to OTHER locations Some cancel Halfway there I mean really lets get it together PLEASE,0.5476220920480235,0.43966165259097617,0.012716255361000248
7,Find another alternative to UBER Their service is horrible and totally dependent on a very limited app to try to resolve any issues Impossible to actually connect with a representative from the company Have been over charged and incorrectly charged for cancellation fees when the cancellation was not my fault Instead of refunding the incorrect charge it is still there even though the app says it was refunded Its always a gamble as to what type of driver you will get Some have been nice professional Many have been totally rude Uber also does very little to insure rider safety regarding CDC and county practices regarding COVID,0.009371533254236996,0.9818206744538192,0.008807792291943891
8,This has been a problem way more than once now in the morning is schedule my uber for 7:40 My drivers have been early multiple times and Im not talking like u know 3 or even 5 minutes early its like 1520 minutes early And then Im rushing around the house to finish getting ready I cant make them wait either because uber can charge me for having them wait So I tried scheduling it maybe 7:45 7:50 ish but when i do that the drivers get there late and I get to work late,0.009360814062771675,0.5565154492998291,0.4341237366373992
9,Works well enough but for those of us who pay an extra $16 to reserve a ride (a ridiculous amount when what were actually doing is guaranteeing a driver a fare) it would sure be nice to have a notification that a driver had accepted the ride and have that notification show up when we look at our upcoming trips Imagine waiting at 5am hoping but not knowing if someone is actually going to pick you up for your trip to the airport,0.2670483025496752,0.03062860503217508,0.7023230924181497
10,Paid for priority and the food delivery was still very late It would have been more effective of my time if I went with my own car In addition the user rating system is broken because if I dont like the service/driver and choose not to tip the driver or person delivering can give you a lower rating,0.4446334313649536,0.3629330461491372,0.19243352248590925
11,Its great when they arent jacking the prices up The thing is I shouldnt be paying 10 dollars to get to work and 20 dollars to get home or vice versa I grasp that there areemberships etc but really there is that much of a difference Meanwhile Lyft has my fare for the standard 10 dollars and its not inconsistent and a pain in the neck to get a ride to work Ridiculous Ive been using Uber for a year now and its slowly gone downhill Deleting this garbage app,0.6999034885649148,0.012676371474442344,0.287420139960643

297,Working customer service is always taught me to be a little more lenient when it comes to issues of using any kind of service but the experience Ive had with the Uber app for the past 3 days have been by far the worst app experience Ive ever had in my life lets just start off with the fact that out of the blue the app would refuse to take any of my payment methods directly meaning that the only way I could have requested any kind of ride service from Uber with either through Google pay or Pay,0.27458103260805183,0.7164670263554627,0.00895194103648553

730,Im usually happy with Uber but this morning I was already waiting outside with my child when the driver canceled at the literal last minute  my destination was 1km up the road and so I imagine he canceled because it was too short I have had a number of friends mention the same thing  that their drivers cancel on them for short trips Thereafter I battled for half an hour to secure a trip even though there were drivers in the area Highly unprofessional  inconvenient NOT recommended,0.010354522990930376,0.6026057106745174,0.38703976633455217

732,Very unreliable in several ways Do NOT expect this app to get you to work or anywhere else on time The chief issue Im finding is that drivers will sometimes not come to you The app will predict a 10 minute wait but this often becomes 40+ minutes as the driver accepts but then goes somewhere entirely different first They will list themselves as completing a trip nearby I have even had instances where the driver just stopped (in one case for over an hour) and did not come at all  there is a penalty for them cancelling themselves so some will just wait out for you to do so so you tank the fee In this case I left the app on to see what they would do because I wasnt in a hurry but mostly I end up having to cancel after waiting and go flag down a regular cab Reporting this kind of thing is conveniently difficult and the system is automated and pretty terrible The issue is persistent and theyve done nothing to address it The app itself is buggy with a clunky chat system that doesnt load correctly push notifications are delayed and the whole thing is glitchy Its very poorly coded and has a tendency to crash when you need it most even on a new phone If you live in a city like I do you are always faster just going outside to flag down a regular cab,0.21496157241561803,0.5468808558320232,0.23815757175235877
