0,More stable than in the past but more frustrating to use My Firefox is stuck in a fullscreen activity and I cant find how to turn it off The UI and user options are completely trash and even less intuitive to navigate than the desktop Firefox Mozilla seems to have become a feckless organization and I will no longer be donating What an absolute joke I hope you replace the person Making such outdated and horrible decisions,0.973073262,0.012856325,0.014070414
1,Its getting better but after the most recent updates the search engines wont hold their settings I dont seem to have the same problem in chrome or other browsers Ive tried It only seems to be firefox that has this problem I can open the settings page in any of the searches: google bing duck duck go and turn safe search on off or strict when I hit save it all goes back to default and wont save settings I hope you can address this issue in an update,0.009985971,0.979837737,0.010176292
2,This app used to be great but not anymore Just another example of software engineers constantly changing things to justify their jobs They have moved the back forward and refresh buttons into the three dots menu making it a pain to use these basic functions Overall the app has become the opposite of why I liked it in the first place Uninstalling it for now Ill try back again in a year maybe,0.809939961,0.013008413,0.177051626
3,I used to love the app until the last update The browser hides the android buttons for back and home along the bottom of my screen and the time signal and battery icons along the top screen Change it so you have the option of setting your custom settings to not having to swipe down to back up I dont need another quarter inch of screen space I would much rather be able to back up or go to menu in a single motion or I dont know be able to see if I am still connected to the internet,0.97935351,0.010307865,0.010338625
4,The UI is miserable its so taxing to navigate anywhere within the settings Options like Print page and Search through Bookmarks are gone The Bookmark manu looks awful and handles like its from the 90s Cant figure out how to pull up desktop tabs now Theres great lack of addons now Data collection is on by default No data saving web compression feature like Chrome History has no sorting or search feature,0.22624064,0.602529796,0.171229564
5,With the latest update Why did they hide the back button Now if i want to go back i need to swipe downward first to show the buttons then hit back It doubles the action to back up Every Single Time Please do something in settings to allow me to opt out of that choice My screen is huge and Ill keep the buttons at the bottom thank you,0.966902596,0.016730284,0.01636712
6,I like the app but the browser sometimes hangs quite a bit before loading the site and has trouble loading pictures on quite a few gaming sites I dont like having a bookmark list for desktop and a different one for mobile It annoyingly generates tabs like crazy Video doesnt look as good as on Chrome and loads much slower The UI is a bit ugly and shouldnt just copy Chrome Vivaldi is a much better alternative at the moment I want nothing but endless bookmark icons on my homepage,0.053497473,0.25665576,0.689846768
7,The only reason I have this app on my phone is for a plugin called ublock origin Otherwise I wouldnt waste my time Seems that Mozilla has lost their competence when it comes to writing good browsers Probably only a matter of time before they break the only functionality they have that makes having their product on my phone worth it How about it Mozilla How long until you break Firefox enough for me to completely wipe it off all my systems You guys spent years earning this review,0.009711096,0.010633222,0.979655682

11,With the latest update any time I play a video or game within the browser it stays in full screen mode after  so any webpage hides the notifications at the top of screen More importantly it hides the edge panel so I can switch apps rapidly I can reset it out of full screen mode under settings by reenabling navigation buttons but thats tedious after every time I view a video And I thought Id never have to go back to Chrome ,0.977900238,0.010970356,0.011129406
12,Pretty good but some annoying bugs: 1 With the Firefox toolbar at the bottom some menu options recently became unusable because theyre covered by on screen Android buttons and 2 Desktop site for pages gets mixed up sometimes when switching tabs with other tabs taking over the desktop view tab or desktop site option just not giving a desktop view after going to another tab then returning to the tab thats using the desktop site option,0.370658987,0.008598277,0.620742736

315,More update with less UI customization that was a reason why I use firefox over other browser New UI is optimized for bottom bar When I choose a TOP address bar Im expexted other menu at the top too Also I dont want to see anything in new page except blank Collection tab is a matter of privacy too Update: Still the same tab list is still optimized for bottom menu,0.014585088,0.972992813,0.012422099
316,Firefox had always been my default browser but I had to change this since last update Samsungs so useful bottom navigation bar suddenly disappears forcing users to several gestures just to go back to previous page There are also problems with text size Google search results for example abruptly get giant text size What has happened The app WAS really great,0.973956399,0.013320344,0.012723257
317,Used Firefox for years on various platforms On Android it has become rubbish It has become visually unappealing no longer shows all the tabs that have not been manually closed and arbitrarily deletes older ones It was worth 5 stars now its not really worth 1 I really would like to continue using it but not as it has become DuckDuckGo is going to be my goto browser from now on alternatively I may also consider Chrome a browser I have never liked,0.011865325,0.237316363,0.750818312

319,I love Firefox and have always preferred it However the latest update which causes the back button to disappear (you have to slide up from the bottom) is stupid and not something I can imagine a lot of people have asked for The silly goal of trying to maximise screen space at any cost results in a very poor user experience People always want to go back and forth between websites and making it harder isnt the way to do that This + the change to websites being in groups = bad UI,0.722485507,0.26663127,0.010883222
320,Mozillas perseverance down a riskier but more innovative path should be applauded and thankfully its slowly finding its feet again Currently the only thing keeping me from Firefox as primary driver is atrocitious Android tablet usability  no desktop mode lock tab bar etc Also please bring back groups Chromium tab stacking is invaluable and the awkwardness of containers doesnt cut the mustard,0.297055575,0.444462088,0.258482336
321,The browser is great but it still suffers from the same problem which always been famous for on all operating systems from the day one After a while its speed slows down dramatically and takes up a lot of RAM space In particular the start up and opening speed slows to the point of regret But still its my default browser on phone and pc,0.015460959,0.967248505,0.017290536

323,Not bad Recently switched to Firefox after years using Yandex Firefox is slower and lacks Yandexs killer textreflow But at least it respects my choices by allowing me to install the extensions I want and doesnt bombard me with a moronic news feed full of vacant zzzelebrity junk every time I install an update Just get a decent textreflow function added will you Many websites are literally impossible to read on a tiny phone screen Why do so few browsers take this into account,0.975862456,0.01036733,0.013770214
324,Long time FF user Mobile app is just a bit rubbish its uncomfortable to use with the gestures for tab management requiring use of the whole screen The addons are a joke theres 17 of rhem Presumably this limit of whitelisted apps is due to the underlying method being problematic with security or stability Customisation of button layout again is limited Its missing most of what makes the desktop app good,0.213538922,0.011867917,0.774593161
325,I use Firefox all the time mostly so I can just listen to music with the Google browser in the background without having the music stopping like YouTube However an annoying thing that does happen is that the music stops when theres an ad in one of my other apps Its really annoying when I have to go back and restart it since I normally use desktop mode to listen to music in the background but when I go back to fix the issue it goes to mobile mode and wont go back on to desktop mode,0.980896566,0.009346986,0.009756448

327,I really like the new homepage with top sites and collections And clicking the search bar to access them is fantastic thats a great feature that other browsers dont have However when I click a top site or collection page it opens in a new tab instead of the same page This is so irritating You end up with 20 tabs on every session Its really annoying Please include an option to customise this,0.265617804,0.38440095,0.349981247
328,Update: Broken Sometimes when switching tasks the webpage will turn black and then even if I restart the app it will not respond Only way to fix it is to forcekill firefox in the OS settings Its been several years since the redesign and just as before we still have no way to close tabs when exiting the app and addon support is basically nonexistant Im very sad that this is the state of mobile firefox but as of now Im switching to Vivaldi,0.21028003,0.011435505,0.778284465

330,Lost functionalities: BitWarden does not work anymore Private Browsing history SYNCS with the desktop so it mixes there with the regular history Open in External App: nope preference setting needs to be manually selected EVERY SINGLE TIME And its slow sooo slow Pages load eventually mostly There is no reason anymore why I should use this browser Not fast anymore not private anymore not safe anymore But hey: we got rid of the word MASTER in master password1,0.00910521,0.397559639,0.593335151
331,the loss of scroll position is incredibly annoying it took me forever to find the new bugzilla instead of the black hole feedback is currently directed to and by then I didnt have the energy to write anything now I dont even remember the other bugs I wanted to report still better than chrome Edit: FFS now its suddenly fullscreen and theres no option to turn it off :( OTOH it seems to lose my scroll position less often now,0.975412897,0.01180028,0.012786823
332,App randomly (but regularly) goes into full screen mode hiding the entire android UI (including the home and back buttons) making it hard to switch to other apps or check notifications This is utterly frustrating and completely breaks the app This needs to be fixed before the app can be considered useable,0.974051046,0.012733643,0.013215311
333,Every update makes FF worse and worse This update has the full screen bug the previous update made it slower And the more features it adds the more bloated it gets Seriously guys just do one thing and do it well We just need a simple web browser with extension,0.256703941,0.015990176,0.727305883

335,I really dislike this redesign and many things either dont work or are missing I hate having no homepage and have a guess where a bookmark saved If you use Bing it wont let it go back with gestures or the arrows You have to close that tab open a new one for Bing then you can navigate backwards Lots of security holes and not repaired fast enough Let it supply an insecure password without special chars The Fenix coders are not open to suggestions in Github The nag page of whats new,0.009875786,0.011337481,0.978786733
336,there are quite a few bugs to fix and changes id like when resuming tabs after leaving firefox in the background sometimes the tab remains black and doesnt fix itself even after a refresh forcing me to close it the app crashes sometimes when i edit or delete a bookmark please let us select multiple bookmarks and reorder them as well as reorder tabs to make organization easier copying link text would also be appreciated,0.234378002,0.010243745,0.755378253
337,I switched to FF from Chrome some time ago and was extremely happy with FF performance But the last update brought a 34 second delay when I started the browser no matter what I tried Very annoying I will change to 5 stars once its fixed Update Feb2022: Well the performance has massively improved,0.016305165,0.017155526,0.966539309

339,The taskbar at the bottom stinks A finger is naturally at the bottom of the screen  every time I scroll up I end up with my finger going across the address bar  changing the page back to my last search After a week of persistence with the new version its still happening Lots of other things going wrong with the view of various regular websites I visit After years of wanting Firefox Im going back to google Stop promising updates/fixes listen to the reviews take it back to the original,0.585031622,0.009956525,0.405011853

341,Im using firefox on a tablet The new layout (v80) makes simple actions like changing tabs opening new tabs reloading etc extremely annoying due to the distance between the relevant buttons and the unstructured layout (e g: why are new tab new private tab and reload buttons not anywhere next to each other Or new tab and reload) Why is about:config no longer working On top of that come the obvious bugs I would really like to get back Firefox 78,0.327462106,0.23229326,0.440244634
342,I used to love firefox but the app is full of bugs Features working well suddenly disappear or get messed up with updates Filed reports are being ignored both on the support page and on github Im sick of it Sending tabs to another device is super annoying especially when you want to send AND close more at a time UX is stupid many times I emphasise again it is difficult to make your voice heard therefore this review,0.510512111,0.010706031,0.478781857
