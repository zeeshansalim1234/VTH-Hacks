0,Literally impossible to log in You can only log in via Magic Links in which you must have access to the email on the same device I can not access my work email on an external device for security reasons and verifying my email on another device will still not allow my mobile device to sign in In response to developer comment: No there is no option to log in with email/password Clicking log in manually ONLY provides a field for Workspace URL which always fails and says not valid,1
1,Notifications are utterly terrible especially if youre ever using the app on more than one platform I understand that theyre trying to monitize but the history limit makes the usability of this for anything important a joke Speaking of money considering that you can get Teams for free what they want for paid accounts is ridiculous The app on most platforms has massive overhead and barely works how do you not have gif integration but you can completely redo the graphics every 3 months,1
2,Unable to login using Google SSO Have reset app cache data cache reinstalled restarted Logo just freezes while trying to auth An app force quit and restart produces a forever bouncing slack logo on the next attempt,1
3,Constantly freezes and stops Wont let you type messages Keeps sending self to home screen Wont let you update status  you can push the button 50 times with no result Desktop app is fine Mobile simply nonfunctional,1
4,Setting status to active seems to have no effect in mobile app status and perhaps others also do not see me as active as a result Changing status to active in desktop edition does not propagate to mobile app,2
5,If the app was working correctly it would be a success because I just love all the features it offers but my desktop version keeps freezing and not working Hopefully they can fix and improve the app because it is worth it,3
6,It was working well and then it stopped Now I cant see the same channels on my phone that are on my laptop and this is after I uninstalled and then reinstalled it,2
7,If you are removed from a server then try to access it the app will always display invalid authentication You cannot go back to any other servers youre in Closing the app will not reset this,1
8,good app things nice easy to navigate and stuff i only think negitively of this app because my team ended up short staffed and many members quit on short notice so we couldnt find anyone to fill in their place and the animators had to rush to complete their assigned pieces so the film we were making got canceledplease plan ahead you will thank yourselves later get staff who will both manage the group but also serve as back ups incase a member quits PLEASE ITS HELLoverworked animator,4
9,We have been using an archaic listserv app and it is getting quite noisy This is a refreshing change,3
10,Ever since the latest Android update I am unable to post anything in slack It allows me to write what I want to post but when I try to post it it does nothing Im highly frustrated,1
11,I cant log in After entering my login info it takes me back to the main screen which asks me sign in manually again Please fix,1
12,Returning to the app from the launcher icon starts it from scratch It should simply resume it as any app does same how it resumes from Recents menu Pixel 5 android 12,1
13,Buggy Cant support images well Support taking forever to fix the issue,4
14,Not suitable for Android users I cant even log in to Slack using this mobile app and have been trying for the past three months now to no avail Every time I try to log in I get taken to my phone settings with no instructional messages or prompts So I have no idea what Im supposed to be doing in my settings to get it to work Please do better If we sign in via desktop the mobile process should be seamlessbut it isntterrible,1
15,I have a real problem getting alerts on my phone with this app The alerts are on but sometimes I get them anywhere from a few hours late to a few days late then the alert doesnt always clear after viewing so it looks like I have alerts that I dont have This is problematic because I use this for work and its the primary way my work contacts me as we are decentralized Please help,3
16,I was very leery of Slack in the beginning and now I love it and its reputation The sheer simplicity of how they make integration of all their apps To install or Uninstall I do wish it had a little more for user preference settings Thats just because sight and lighting can just be picky Only reason Soothing color combos seem to help But sometimes you just have to turn up the music and hope your dime get a headache from the fun,4
17,This app is little more than a read/reply version of the desktop version There are no options for customization sorting deleting channels/threads etc Unread channels conveniently move to the top of the stack so you need to scroll all over the place to find a channel If I didnt need to stay connected to work conversations if delete immediately,3
18,This app has a good bit of features that are nice Like theme personalization and having a personal thread for quick notes It also syncs settings instantly between devices However its a battery hog when open and in the background Huddles are nearly useless on my Duo When I open a thread the prompt to join a huddle often crashes the whole app And when someone stops a screen share in a huddle it crashes Contacted support  Im not hopeful despite them being very kind,3
19,I feel like Android app recent update made organization of channels worse Just one flat group of everything  where are the custom sections and ways to organize In an enterprise with hundreds of channels its useless and almost impossible to find the channels I need to monitor,1
20,A mess Interface is not user friendly  everything is really confusing to get a handle of  and its so *buggy*  sign in not working  screens flashing  buttons not working  etc  to bosses and teachers everywhere: for the love of the people in your group  DONT USE THIS  just make a discord server or something  same thing but less buggy and A LOT easier to use  trust me  your group will thank you ,1
21,Galaxy S21 / Android 12  As others have reviewed the push notifications are essentially worthless Most often the push notifications are never delivered In those rare cases they are delivered its usually hours after the post to the Slack channel Email notifications are substantially more reliable but whats the point of having email notifications enabled when push notifications are enabled Until the push notifications are fixed the Slack apps best use is opening it up to send a message Just dont expect to get a reply via push notification ps Slack Robot no I will not send an email to feedback at Slack unless you want to put me on your payroll to help troubleshoot your app,2
22,Hmthis is the second time Im finding my review missing Anyway issue was resolved by using the option to signin manually the email link received worked and was able to sign in with android phone Dont use the other option (sending a magic link to your email) Signin manually with your email reset password and then a magic link will be sent to your email that actually works,1
23,My work uses Slack Im a software developer Slack stinks of bugs and lack of professionalism They change UI and features without concern for existing user productivity deprecate OS and browser versions on a whim etc 1 You can no longer delete zoom call msgs 2 On Android replies to a thread AND channel is now a multi step process 3 On Linux it insists opening its own browser process and reopen all my default tabs with it Etc Not enough room here to list all the faults,1
24,Black screens in every thread Pixel 6 pro and pixel 5 We just got stuck with this BS COVID19 hit and this was our best option Obviously the app was popular with devs because you can do cool things like alert you when a sale has been made and the documentation was great The pitfalls of slack are going to be the pitfalls of our society The app is mediocre regardless,2
25,This app has a lot of potential however its inconsistent and therefore problematic For example the status update sometimes fails to save despite user feedback that it does Often its also not possible to access and respond to messages that are in thread,2
26,The fact that I am forced to download the desktop version in order to make changes to the mobile version is absolutely ridiculous My notification setting is always changing itself to pause for seemingly no reason at all I constantly have to change it back to giving me notifications,1
27,Why you changed the left sidebar (list of channels and conversations) BG colors on mobile app Im having very different expirience on mobile than on desktop now hard to immediately understand what is going on if Im constantly switching between mobile and desktop slack apps This is very strange move It is not fixable by enabling the dark mode as I want to have the same set of colors on mobile app as on desktop app for the same app areas as on desktop while not in dark mode,2
28,Just received a link to join app for work purposes Its terrible I cant even sign up It gives me an error message with all/any email I use I cant even sign up with the workspace URL,1
29,Great way to communicate just last week our email was down from 8 am to 2 pm on a Wednesday during peek work hours We have been using slack as an alternative way of communicating This platform enables people to interact with out the normal online distractions of other aops,5
30,They destroyed the interface with this last update I have no desire to use the mobile app anymore it is no longer convient Bring back the old UI Edit: Still liked the old interface better but gotten used to the new one Still get the occasional bug but overall fine,2
31,UPDATE: very strange that i cannot edit my own review in here but i solved my issue After i made the Google account Default (the one i need to use to sign into Slack workspace) i logged out from all the workspaces deleted the cache reinstalled the app and it works now I was able to login into the workspace that i need to use I dont know if its a Google thing or Slack but this needs to be solved I shouldnt need to go through Security Settings in order just to login into a Slack,2
32,The app works well in tablet mode on a chromebook However there are issues when trying to navigate the map when in computer mode on my chromebook,3
33,Mostly great but I would like to request a widget for viewing dms and posts tagged in Sometimes with a big company it is easy to lose things or not catch it This would be a big help Thanks,4
34,Love Slack  generally speaking it gets 4 stars But this 2 star review is for whatever change they made to the app since I last updated umpteen months ago: I lost the ability to make channel shortcuts on my homescreen HUGE THUMBS DOWN,2
35,Cant remove or sign out of workspaces Dont use the mobile app If you have to use slack stick with a browser This is a bug theyve known about for a long time and will likely never fix,1
36,The copy link doesnt actually copy the link Most of the stuff people share on slack I want to either open on a different device or in Incognito so I need to be able to copy it from my Android Now I have to do copy text and delete whatever their commentary was on the link I wish that slack updates didnt break the app so often and I wish theyd fix it faster when things like this do happen Due to the amount of bugs they should really streamline reporting them too,2
37,Is there even development done on mobile app for slack Videos never get played when uploading a video from phone it take insane amount of time Same video on Google drive in few seconds Whats the point of having an attachment option if we just have to share Google drive like ,1
38,Mobile notifications are garbage and have been for the past 3 years Sigh Cant find a reliable way to get notifications on my samsung phone/watch,1
39,Its ok I suppose I only use it because my employer doesnt seem to realize we really dont need another message app especially one thats not even end to end encrypted,3
40,Really well done mobile version of the desktop application Simple clean easytouse as the desktop version is,5
41,It needs to break down how channels can be minimal even being used through company work its very confusing for me and I have ADHD I get really confused because its so scattered Im still learning its new for me,2
42,Still unable to change profile picture with new update which is the only reason I got the mobile app Unsure why it was taken off,2
43,Fun secure chat used twice now for different jobs I love the emojis I have not figured out how to add custom ones but I see customs in there a lot,4
44,App constantly crashes when being in a huddle with Bluetooth headphones Maybe fix this,1
45,No option for unread messages making the app just garbage the most important question is WHY If this option available on desktop,1
46,The doggie daycare sent me the app to see pics and stay in touch about my puppy while shes there I like it Thanks,4
47,An awful glitchy frustrating experience I wish every conceivable misfortune befalls its developers,1
48,Log in problems no customer support terrible interface huge disappointment,1
49,why cant i use mark up on mobile you think its easier to use the smart formatting menu on mobile Have you tried using any mark up on mobile at all you broke triple quotes () do you guys use slack yourselves or does some 23 year old designer call all the shots with no testing,1
50,Cannot change time zone even though theres a setting listed that would seem to allow this On mobile sometimes has problems marking channels as read even after closing app opening channel scrolling to end and up and reopening channels panel No edit history on shared editable text snippets,2
51,Please use the update descriptions for actual information Edit: yes I mean the release notes What does this mean: What’s New • No news is good news Well some news can also be good news or no news could perhaps lead to uncertainty and speculation on par with bad news but in this case our absence of news is a good thing Or at least not a bad thing No news is just fine Carry on,3
52,Its okay However I frequently have new messages notifications but these messages do not show up in the app The app will highlight the channels with unread messages but visiting these channels only shows the old messages Nothing helps to solve the issue: killing the app restarting the phone clearing the cache The only way is to either go to the desktop app or wait for another message to be sent in that channel and hope that it will solve the issue This is very frustrating,3
53,This app has caused me so much work stress Issues: No phone call notifications on Googles WearOS smart watch * when you get a call and pick it up on desktop it is marked as missed on your phone and leaves a ghost window * the connection quality is so bad compared to dedicated phone calls voice drops in and out comes through laggy * background noise is terrible over voice Definitely worse than a standard work call So bad that people cant understand others and complain about he noise * sometimes calls dont wake my phone at all yet a regular phone call can all the time * the app is slow and bloated feeling just like the desktop version (which is really pretty good tbh) Sure I cant blame this all on slack it is in some ways a hardware and OS issue But theyve set the expectation and they should still know the pain Feature requests: * record calls client side (for privacy) automatically so I can play then back (autodelete after N time unless otherwise specified by the user) ** automatically record calls I was invited to but was not able to answer persons currently in the call should know that such a feature is enabled however * phone call notifications on WearOS * Show your online status of any desktop instance from your phone,1
54,Ill change this after they either get back to me or fix this Android  my new message notifications wont go away as if I havent seen them and I can no longer view older messages from those same people I also go on a channel and itll say 10+ new messages and theyre not new Ive seen them but the notification keeps sending me way up the channel for no reason No updates to fix these bugs,1
55,Ive never had any issues with this app I use it just for messaging my boss nothing else I cant speak to the other features it has but sending pictures/messages/emojis seems to work just fine Occasionally there is a glitch but I think youll be hardpressed to find an app that doesnt glitch every now and again Good concept good app I especially like the search messages feature which has saved me a few times when trying to look back and find an address or something,4
56,Startup on demand needed I dont want to be on call 24/7 and I dont want this app to run all day long and only when I need it to I want the ability to sign on to the app without individually connecting to channels I use,3
57,So close This is a great platform for communication but the mobile notifications are appalling They are either nonexistent or are sent after a long period of time This has been brought up by others for a while now and hasnt been delt with It does me and Im sure others no good at all if we cant communicate in a timely fashion With the competition of other similar platforms being so fierce you folks REALLY need to put on your boots and deal with this Fix this and its 5 stars,2
58,This app has gotten worse over the past few weeks It used to be pretty smooth Now the screen jumps around constantly It notifies way too much every pic upload interrupts what you are doing with a big ugly popup This is not needed It makes the screen jump and pulls you off of text or what you have moved on to The way it saves and uploads pics is so out dated 1 pic a time I have to use my own camera app and transfer yhem over in groups It is a very sloppy app HAVE TO USE FOR WORK,1
59,Very useful communication device with awesome additional features and control of notifications Excellent for business use Lately the experience has become inconsistent 1 The app will erase my draft/message Im typing if I rotate my screen or put the app in the background 2 The app will remove the attachment before I send it when I begin typing a message to go with it Happy to help if the developer wants to work together to gather examples,4
60,I use Slack daily for school and Ive loved it for over a year now But lately (in the last week or two) I will open the app and instantly get signed out of a workspace with the error Invalid Authentication I have to sign back in and then it will happen again in another 5 or 10 mins Its becoming unusable at this point,1
61,Im so irritated I have sections created to make it easy to find my channels for certain things They are pointless 2 of my sections are duplicated in a long list (but they are not shown together) So seemingly random channels are in one of two different sections that have the same section name This is not so on desktop  just mobile,2
62,All of a sudden Ive been kicked out of the app for invalid authentification 5 times in the last 15 mins or so Could barely finish typing out a message Have had the app for at least 2 years now and never had a problem before now Hoping this will be resolved soon because it is also affecting my notifications today,1
63,When this app stops functioning properly (thankfully not too often) I realized how much I depend on it for communicating with my coworkers While theres always room for improvement this is by far the best messaging app out there Ive used Discord G Chat and Teams but none of them compare,2
64,This app is great in concept I have lots of issues with not getting notifications or getting them inconsistently however this is something I have worked past the current issue is since the most recent update I continue to get logged out randomly while on the app with a invalid authentication error message this is absolutely frustrating while Im responding to urgent work concerns,2
65,IT IS COMPLETELY UNUSABLE NOW A) Keyboard keeps closing or triggering different UI reactions after a second so its almost impossible to type anything of value B) Any context switch or another UI pops up you lose all your text in the current input box You have to go to the draft window to find them What was Salesforces point for purchasing Slack then killing it with poor enhancements Roll back all your changes The system was working better before Salesforce,1
66,Used to be great but crashes frequently now and needs to be restarted constantly (latest version of app and Android) Uploads fail notifications are spotty at best and generally more frustrating to use overall This is all on dedicated wifi so definitely the app thats the problem Slack started out great but are slacking in their success  will be happy to change this to 5 star if bugs are addressed,2
67,Its Slack This should be a 5 star app Know why it isnt You cannot SELECT AND COPY TEXT in messages WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY Edit  thanks for the reply I know I can copy the entire message This is frustratingly useless when you want to copy a word or phrase or number from a blob of text Like when you are in the midst of a production/ops problem and are collaborating with other fix agents on a critical issue Guys Please this is really inexcusable,1
68,App is quite detailed have to put your mind to work when using not real easy to setup the business aspect is well informative however model structure is some what confusioning Good app for a the leaning of a bussiness account to control every direction in which your core people are well informed also keeps management on the progress of the project and each task that is performed,3
69,Utterly terrible app for 2 critical reasons 1) Single sign on you have multiple accounts to manage for each group dealing with that across devices is very painful 2) notifications fail regularly I waste many hours debugging slack notifications and the issue had persisted across devices,1
70,The app will not let me sign in It keeps telling me that I have a wrong email address or password but when I sign in on my browser using the exact same email and password it works just fine This has been incredibly inconvenient,2
71,My Slack stopped working after update on 9/22/21 Android 711 So sad Cant even open messages I need it at my federal job so I can leave my desktop Was hoping I could see through my phones web browser but nope Now I have to rush shop a new phone Slack support staff was very quick  polite with my emails I think Slack should poll their members to ask what phones they use before pulling the plug My phone is only about 4 years old and works fine for most popular apps,1
72,App keeps booting me from calls on my Pixel 6 There would be times where I managed to stay on the call for about a minute then I would get booted For most of the time it boots from the call almost instantly This doesnt happen on the desktop client,1
73,Sitting here with wifi and the app has completely crapped out on me and now I cant get back in to any chat that I was part of It just says slack is offline and try again later Done this for 2 days now and cant do my job without it,1
74,Pretty subpar experience compared to desktop I have to manually clear the cache multiple times a day to see new messages and lately Ive been getting logged out randomly when Im typing a message due to invalid authentication,3
75,I have recently been facing too many issues with slack Messages do not pop up And the most recent issue is that slack is not connecting to my mobile network due to which it shows me as offline and i am unable to send or receive messages over slack,2
76,It used to save drafts of messages if you navigate away for a second and now it clears out the entire message not only when navigating away but also if you pull down a notification Please fix,3
77,Cant setup on Pixel 6 When I choose to email a magic link and select my rooms to join and click next on my phone it just crashes EDIT: Ended up having to sign in separately and not use the magic links Once I got beyond that the app works properly again The magic link portion doesnt work though at least on the Pixel 6,1
78,Worked great until today Samsung Note 10+ Android 11 Unable to send messages Can receive Reinstalled App unable to log in to usual workspace Unable to send email to log in Unable to use app to report issue Edit: back to normal after major outage,1
79,It was nice to have a seperate place to chat specifically with my publisher and fellow authors while working on our fiction anthology The app lets you categorize separate subjects for your group to talk about This is perfect for group projects with multitiered aspects,5
80,It used to drop calls around 12 times per use Now I cant take myself of Do Not Disturb which has made the app entirely unusable This is happening on my older model Android and also on my friends new iPhone Negative stars,1
81,Excellent way to communicate particularly for campaigns Happy to have had it on many campaigns in the last five years Gives organizers and team leads a private channel to communicate while coordinating simultaneous events trainings etc,5
82,Doesnt work properly I never get notifications can not view pinned messages (I was added to slack by a company I just started working for) and it constantly logs me out which contributes to missed notifications,1
83,Just recently switched to a Pixel 6 and I cant connect videos or audio calls Ive seen some people complaining about it as well so I expected that to happen Everything else works great though,3
84,Accidentally signed out of one slack (because its too easy to do on mobile) Couldnt log back into that slack because it would not take sms and ate a backup code Now the app wont open at all and just goes to the app download website instead,1
85,I use this only for staying in contact with Amazon management This app keeps logging me out on my phone and I have to reconnect at work on a work computer VERY INCONVENIENT when trying to message work before coming in,1
86,App worked fine for months now cant view messages or reply or post Have to completely wipe cashe and data and re sign in to work for only a few hours then it screws up again,2
87,Really useful Makes me suspicious I still use it every damned day though and YOU should too unless youre one of those blokes with 17000 actionable emails in your inbox You know who you are,4
88,Hangs most of the time and takes a lot of time for loading Calling is a disaster stopped using slack for calling lately stated to call using a different medium and use slack for scree share Screen sharing is good,2
89,Want to revert back to preupdate Well you all REALLY screwed it up with that update Was pretty good app but now cant have list of channels on side to switch back and forth to Who the hells brilliant idea was that IDIOT Please fix it back dumba**es No option to change it,1
90,This sucks Difficult to sign in navigate and not user friendly Were better of using email and text Whats the point of Slack Its just another messaging app and an incredible waste of time,1
91,What is the point of a communication app when it doesnt notify you of new messages I do like the layout of it,4
92,Horrible UX Impossible to send pictures and always fails to load them Finding and creating chats is so difficult Why not make it like any other IM app and stop hiding all the different chats you have going on,1
93,Currently app repeatedly logs me out with invalid authentication every time I use it Im able to get maybe 3 messages before the error occurs Until fixed browser is necessary,1
94,Its functional but the lack of options to organize the sidebar makes it hard to use Also occasionally not getting notifications I would expect,3
95,My biggest issue is the difference between desktop and mobile  You can see the react emojis However you cant see who reacted to your comment unless youre on the desktop version,3
96,Unbelievablely dumb decision to have gif search be random and you have to shuffle it Garbage Wouldnt work when on VPN without telling the user why had to switch VPN location in order to use it,1
97,Awful Cannot have a conversation with anyone because the app constantly loses connection Just continually says lost connection reconnecting,1
98,I do not like the drafts feature It is trash and needs to go Save 1 draft only and do it in the buffer you type into,1
99,Started using this with my extended family We love that there are different channels so that different conversations can be in different places,5
100,Everyone in here that has a pixel 6 is having the same issue You are completely unable to use the calls functionality Ive reached out to the email address but do you have any kind of work around or,1
101,App keeps logging me out and jittering and the new ui sucks compared the old one They should just distribute the apk from 2020 and stop wasting their time with pointless and ugly updates,1
102,This is hands down the worst chat tool Ive ever used Slack is a great name for it though cause it never works it just slacks off and decides its not responding Absolutely garbage software Aim was prehistoric and bad to use but it actually let me send messages How is it that 25 years later slack cant even send a message without freezing and crashing This is embarrassing,1
103,The app doesnt notify me about new messages I only get to see them once Im emailed about it but thats about 3 days later,2
104,Times me out constantly I have to log into my work computer to access on my phone at least every 15 minutes Ridiculous,1
105,Easy to understand and use I love the feature of also being able to use Zoom within the app itself,5
106,been such a great app to communicate with to my teachers helps me a lot especially that i am homeschooling :>,5
107,This app was working great but since today I was getting absolutely no messages and no I reinstalled slack and now I cant back in,1
108,It will not continue to run on an Android you have to reconfigure every time you want to use it,1
109,Great but still not quite FB messenger Yet the thread feature is almost a Messenger killer Plus my FB hating friends will use it,4
110,An annoyance I am forced to live with now and absolutely irritating to update the app on a desktop Extremely annoying and not user friendly,1
111,Any resemblance to one nonstatic static nonliving and or living is coincidental Discernment and discretion may be advised,1
112,This app never updates my messages for urgent matters And when I go to close a conversation it just stays in limbo amd wont go away,1
113,Slack has gone from the best app Ive ever used to the WORST app Ive ever used Sadly after 6 years we have to retire using it and use something that is like basically simply WORKING We cannot even freaking TYPE anymore without Slack closing Horrific please REVERT BACK to 2016 and FIRE THE NEW DEVELOPERS,1
114,Love this app takes a lot of cpu though this gifs keep us going during the day but sometimes also freezes system up,4
115,I cannot change my profile picture for the life of me once this issue is fixed I will update my stars,3
116,Its a mobile version of the chat software the have Its great for keeping in contact with the office,5
117,Overall the app works better than the desktop version Slack is great and makes company communications easy :),5
118,It was nice until it logged me out for some authorization error and erased all my saved workspaces for no reason,2
119,Not a great app Hard to use and very slow sometimes Discord is a far better choice,2
120,As an employee of a company who uses slack for internal communication this app is convenient when Im away from my desktop computer I had a little trouble setting it up on my new phone (with no setup issues on my old phone) but found out it was because selecting my email from auto complete added a space and the space after the email prevented me from being able to select next and continue setup Issue now resolved,4
121,My Apple friends dont have issues but those of us with Androids at work have big issues New messages dont pop up  I have to search for the channel and see the new messages The channel itself disappears from the list I work at a school and we only use slack Fearful i might miss an emergency with a student bc of these issues I really hope they fix them Looking forward to a good update,1
122,I give this 4/5 stars since I think this is a good app The 1 star comes from the strange login method You have to enter the workspace url then your email Its a troublesome thing to remember especially if your place names it something strange with various numbers (like mine) I end up doing the secondary log in method every time (which kind of is also a pain since I then have to check my email for the code),4
123,If you try to use the browser in the phone the came with an excuse that they having problem to log you This is to make you download the app Update: They told me they dont support mobile browser Again The correct answer would have been: We restrict browser on mobile devices,1
124,Fantastic tool to message your colleagues Especially if you work on a team I love that it categorizes your specific Channel from others Has options like adding favs and showing contacts you spoke with last enter info for Zoom meetings team challenges schedule changes etc Within your channel youll message publicly  also have private message options No business should go without using this app,5
125,Seems to work great and is easy to use once your set up but I had some problems signing in This problem happened with my coworker as well I gave it my email and it says to open my email and click the magic link After I click the magic link (confirmation button) from my computer where it is a lot easier to navigate and use my email it opens up the app on my computer rather than signing in on my phone I had to sign in manually inputting the url of my workplace first,3
126,Works great on desktop but Im unable to signin on the mobile app Each login attempt resolves with an error Something went wrong Please try again Ive uninstalled cleared local data and changed from beta to release Ive not able to login using the magic link,2
127,They dropped Android 7 support What a terrible idea Any reasons for the essentially JS app Take a look at Outlook policy or any other communication app They still work without any problems,1
128,Ive been trying to download this app to my softwarecurrent Samsung Galaxy Note20 for 6 days and it never gets past pending Ive tried turning my phone on/off cycling my VPN turning off my VPN trying wifi trying cellular and trying to clear Google Play cache No issues downloading other apps this morning,1
129,In all my years using applications Ive never used an app that is as terrible and poorly developed as slack Its fine once you get into a page but if you havent signed in in a while you might as well never try again Absolute trash,1
130,I would love to use this app again But for some reason the app wont even install  the first time Ive ever had an app from the Play Store that wouldnt install in the years of my Android use Sent in feedback for review from Slack but its definitely not a good sign,2
131,Update: app seems to be working again I have had difficulty editing channel names as well as I keep seeing a past memeber that I removed from our workspace in my app,3
132,The app has always had minor issues in the past messages not showing gifs never work right Some polls wouldnt work Posting videos seem to have random issues But it still seemed to work for what we use it for It is slowly getting better UNTIL NOW I CANNOT GET IT TO WORK SUDDENLY DUE TO NO SUPPORT OF OLDER ANDROID VERSIONS The tech support seems to be less than helpful I hope it will work again and get back to its constant improvement track like it was going,2
133,Get rid of the huddles option Its annoying and useless We use Zoom and have no need for huddles The option to hit one button in a channel and instantly invite everyone to a damn meeting is really annoying The area they put this in and without a second agreement before launching it causes a lot of issues Its at the top of my phone and easy to click when trying to swipe down from the top There should be at least a Yes or no prompt before starting this,1
134,I use this app because its the one my boss has chosen to use as communication for our team Personally I find it challenging to find old message threads archived projects and where and how to post special links for graphs charts and spreadsheets Overall it keeps the team organized I just dont find it very user friendly,4
135,Slack randomly stopped working because of my Android system not being updated enough ie needing to buy a new phone to use Slack However Id still get notifications about messages just not be able to write back on my phone The app still worked HOW RIDICULOUS Worst app ever to literally say buy a new phone to keep using Um nope You are a worthless company if you make everyone buy a new phone to use Sorry but just no Fix this and I will probably come back dont and Ill tell everyone how terrible you are,1
136,Outages are more frequent than they should be Also a notification for every single message no matter how fast or how many are coming from one channel or group can be very annoying I wish there was a setting for max notifications from one channel in ten minutes,3
137,Its okay I have been getting ongoing issues with notifications not being pushed when they should be I am a manager of 2 Spas and need to be ready to answer anyone via slack But when its not letting me know I have a slack I constantly have to be on it Another on going issue Ive had is when I go to read an unopen message and it just doesnt show me it Just past conversations Its very annoying when your job is to be there for your employees but the app you use for communication has bugs,3
138,Most recent string of updates make Android app unusable Threads DMs etc do not update or show an update dot but not have new content Really sad when on a business plan you cannoy trust the app to properly function for business critical functions Update: would give zero stars if possible App continues to be extremely buggy will not load message properly and is often nonfunctional Its bad enough that I have had work team/Dept stop using and working to stop using company wide,1
139,They messed up with the new experience Imagine you talk to someone go to a different app and when you get back you have to scroll/search through hundreds of different channels / dms just to get where you were It was simple before this why are you complicating experience,2
140,I love slack and use it for work I am not happy with you forcing me to love your new collab setrings that render the app unusable until I provide you an email address and check my inbox I am working on a deadline critical project and now have to go back tp my desktop to complete this What about a reminder for later Are we partnering here That is fine that you need to authenticate me and my email what about allowing me to pick a time that works to do that and not take away function,2
141,Line Spacing is horrible A couple months ago they added what feels like 1in of space between lines with no option to revert Less than half of the text usually displayed can now be displayed on the screen Let us adjust this,1
142,Its been great up until yesterday when it stalled all notifications for new groups/group chats I tried all the standard remedies (hard reset power cycle my phone etc) and no change I even did an uninstall/reinstall No change,5
143,I know you think its cute these silly update notifications that contain no useful information but maybe you could consider taking release notes seriously and actually explaining what bugs are being fixed what features are being updated and how the changes will affect us and not treating this like a creative writing exercise in avoiding telling users what youre doing and why,2
144,My main issue is having 13 unnecessary Slack sounds auto downloaded into my music library every time I use it Even when I delete them they keep regenerating Ive tried to adjust multiple settings to keep them from downloading permanently to no avail,2
145,Cannot just open in the brower Both options link to the app store That is useless and annoying,1
146,Update required but doesnt seem to be working just keeps looping back to Update required to keep using app Reinstalled same thing happens Opposite of productive especially since Im in the middle of doing things using Slack,2
147,Can you please remove the notification from my phone after I already see it on my computer Sometimes it finally goes away if I just turn the phone screen on Sometimes I have to actually open the app or clear it from the notifications bar,1
148,Unable to use slack since last update Message popup within app indicates that an update is needed but when you click the message there are no updates available Popup message cannot be dismissed,1
149,No previous deprecation notices no new version on google play but this version is suddenly not supported Missing meetings right now figuring out what to do Awful,1
150,had difficulty speaking with members during midnight hours seemed as though there was some default do not disturb setting and communication was hindered,2
151,I very rarely leave reviews That said this app is unusable aside from notifications I downgraded to its 2019 version Its been my experience that whenever I open any channel or DM and begin typing I have around 10 seconds to write a sentence or the app will crash This has been consistent throughout most of the year but this current iteration crashes even faster than any other version Ive used,1
152,The only issue I have is with alerts Itd be nice to have the option to have a separate alert for every channel/thread update Currently after tapping on the mobile alert I have to check the channel listing to see what channels have new messages Maybe there could be a delayed notification when app is no longer active that says you still have unread updates This could be disabled in settings of course,3
153,I dont get it Why fix (break) what wasnt broken Before I used to be able to start a post come back to it and everything was there Add a photo to a post No problem Now when I leave the app  come back my posts disappear from the channels I wrote them in  automatically get transferred to the Drafts channel Whats even more maddening is without even leaving the app if I want to take a photo to add to a post once I take the photo the post has likewise disappeared moved to Drafts,1
154,Its signing people out of their account saying invalid authentication Ive been using Slack for a couple years now and never had this problem,1
155,V hard to find a message again if you leave it to read another Web site on Android refuses to let you sign in insisting you use the app,1
156,Its like an improved version of Discord but geared toward the needs of businesses/organizations Makes it easy to organize large events coordinate with folx working together on a project(s) communicate effectively with everyone in a business/organization from top to bottom speed the implementation of new regulations deadlines technolgy etc *And* its actually fun to use I was almost sad when I didnt have a need for it anymore Super awesome app I recommend for a multitude of purposes,4
157,I was working my way through the morethanusuallynonunderstandable Terms of Service trying to figure out whether I was a Customer or an authorized user or something completely different when I tried to set cookie preferences that were blocking half the screen and everything disappeared The app is impossible One can not even read the Terms of Service much less agree to them if one wants to and after reading as far as I did I probably would not have agreed to them,1
158,Very reliable I mainly use this for my family but have used it to coordinate with numerous people The private message and group message is great to use when discussing individual or a coop effort Having the capability to have multiple rooms for separate projects or conversations is great It links with drives calendars and notes to keep track of your daily/weekly/monthly functions,5
159,I have to use this app for work Notifications are always spotty and this is a huge issue My boss will message my team channel and I often dont get notifications of his new messages on my desktop or my phone My team members have the same problem so we are constantly having to check for new communications just in case something has come in that we have missed,1
160,Not the app for me But might be great for some It kinda like a FB  But not as sharable to the world  like you have to have an invite Or you not in or cool Not Tertaly enough for the turtle club kinda app  Similar to a whats app Yeah like that ,3
161,I downloaded a new version update since it notified me to before Sept 1 2021 on my mobile app However I actually preferred my previous older version because I was able to have a background color theme on my cell of purple color Now the only option is white or dark mode in black This is terrible White is too plain and black dark mode is very dark I went to preferences and dont see any color theme options for cell phones with the new version Will you be updating this soon Thanks,2
162,After recent update the android app is completely broken on my chromebook I can sign in but the right hand pane where convos should exist isnt even there If I select a channel I can see the existing convoit opens in like a full window and the panel list on the left is gone And from there the back button doesnt work so I cant get back to the channel list without closing the app out and starting over,1
163,The new interface is cleaner and smoother but there are some key things that make it difficult/annoying: (1) Saved messages is under the You section Why Seems like it would be better in the second menu where Channel Browser and People are located (2) Notifications are not working correctly Delayed and/or no notifications or notifications when I set it to Just mentions in a channels,3
164,The past week and a half the app has stopped working properly Some messages arent fetched at all and are simply missing and some messages refuse to send from the mobile side despite no other messaging application having issues I love slack but this is causing a lot of issues It also appears to be happening on the iOS version I use as well Please help,2
165,Disappointed I cannot view others shared screen Also the call reconnect logic isnt very robust My WiFi is not very stable due to lots of nearby APs so my WiFi drops frequently Slack detects the network drop says it is reconnecting but it hangs forever and I have to force kill the app before I can rejoin calls Happens multiple times per day Boo,2
166,I miss your old logo Your new one is boring and stupid and generic wavey design dumbness Your old one was memorable and relevant to your business Too bad so few companies have the insight to look back and take time to rethink old decisions when it comes to marketing Its like everyone is so afraid of making mistakes that nobody will admit when one is made And so you become more boring and more stale The renegade antiemail Slack becomesjust another type of email App is fine I guess,1
167,Probably the most frustrating experience Ive had with an app Have tried installing across multiple devices multiple times Every time I try to create a new workspace it stalls at the company name or the app stops after the prompts Infuriating Doesnt matter how great the app may be if you cant start using the thing Im currently downloading Basecamp,1
168,Its OK but I had initial trouble signing in Ive changed my initial rating from one to 3 stars now that its working The app seems to work OK now but its just one option of many ways to communicate with a group You can integrate with other sharing services (like Google drive and Dropbox) I got it because it was required in a class in taking and it seems to work alright for our purposes Still it feels like just another app in a world thats bloated with too much already,3
169,New review Still trash The layout has not been improved since they changed it a few months ago Video calling was added but its forced into vertical mode and it CONSTANTLY crashes Laptop callers get a horizontal rectangle within the vertical one I cant rotate my phone out of vertical mode Also when I clear notifications its a 50/50 shot they actually clear on that device Its a slim to none chance they clear on others Clearly their priorities are feature quantity and NOT quality,1
170,Doesnt fetch most recent messages Ever since the last update (Im completely up to date as of this review) the app doesnt fetch the most recent messages after I get the notification and go into the app to see/read what was sent It worked perfectly fine until this recent update Cant use it at all without constantly forcing a stop and then reopening the app Super disappointed Not cool to release an update that doesnt work Might have to get my team switched to something else,1
171,Absolutely cannot stand the new full screen multitab interface I opted out of the beta just to get rid of it Now that the update hit Im going to install the previous version Its so annoying  cumbersome Im leaving this review Functionality is still fine as before but I just cant understand who would think these interface changes are an upgrade in any way Wish software companies would stop trying to fix things that arent broken Or at least just make it a setting we can toggle FFS,1
172,The new update is hot garbage Fire your QA team Half the time the app is not showing me the latest messages in a channel Ill get a notification of a new message but it doesnt show up in the channel unless I force close the app and reopen it This is completely unacceptable for a messaging app and it never happened with the previous version Also it diverges from the desktop apps UI in a way that is inconsistent and frustrating Dont fix what aint broke,1
173,Used to love this app I use it for work and social Its gone downhill in the last several months with random restarts wrong status (showing people offline when they arent) poor video experience (dropping calls on solid internet speeds etc) messages seemingly randomly not sending freezing on my pixel2 etc Not impressed anymore If there was a better option Id tell my company to use it I keep hoping it gets back to what I originally loved about it (reliable),2
174,This app has been nothing but a headache since Ive installed it for the sports podcast I am on Instead of the notifications just dropping down it also pushes my active screen slightly back making it difficult to type or pick something I am trying to pick difficult Getting out off snooze mode is difficult if you havent actually figured it out and I dont need that blue notification telling me I have unread messages when Ive read all the messages,1
175,Update is making every interaction I have miserable Its as if the screen freezes every time I try to tap or text like my touch screen is covered with goo But its not my phone  no problem with other apps Everything takes 10 times longer Editing to clarify the similarity to another reviewerss experience where a tap seems to be interpreted as a tiny swipe  so the screen bounces around when I try to place my text input cursor somewhere else in a text box or when I try to tap Enter,1
176,First off I extremely dislike the new layout I say that as nicely as possible More importantly the app is just not working well for me New messages are not loading have to close the app and reopen it for them to show up Notifications are missing at times Many times when I click on a notification if I do get it it takes me to the channel but does not have the latest message so I have to close the app and reopen it,2
177,The app has a lot of potential but is unfortunately ruined for me by a lack of trust and respect for the chosen settings First if I set a DnD then I literally just asked to not be disturbed so please dont give others a oneclick option to override my setting and notify my phone late at night Second please allow me to decide which channels Im in The concept that an app even allows the org owner to make channels mandatory and unleavable again shows a lack of respect for the user I promise I know how I want to use Slack and which channels and notifications are useful to me just let me do it If these issues didnt exist it would be a 5star app but alas it feels pretty bad to not have control of how you use an app,2
178,Missing notifications on Samsung tab s5e There is no red number signifying unread messages on the icon on my home screen (Like on the app for iphone) I have to go into the app to see if there are any unread messages App icon badges is selected in my app settings The settings for notifications are very limited and I cannot adjust anything there It appears there is the option but nothing happens when I click,2
179,You may as well use Gchat or any other IM platform It lets you chat with people but imposes tons of arbitrary restrictions that you wont know about until youre trying to send a file or change your notification preferences (which are busted as hell by the way) or find a conversation you had a long time ago The reason for all of this is they want you to buy a premium plan which my employer a small independent business refuses to do Two of the three problems I have are supposedly better if you have premium but it doesnt change the fact that changing notifications preferences is like pulling teeth and you will get tons of notifications by default to the point where youll want to throw your phone/tablet/computer out a window,2
180,This app is so unreliable Whenever I get messages with preview notification on my phone I cant read them on the app like they were never sent to me How does that even happen Luckily I have the app on my laptop and can see the missing messages there but it is ridiculous how this keeps happening Even when I can clearly see the message on the laptop it does not appear on my phone it just skips to the next one I never had an app with that issue before I would love this app if not for that,1
181,This is one of those apps that everyone uses only because everyone else uses it It doesnt work very well on Android Calls absolutely do not work on Android Bluetooth headsets do not work on Android Screen sharing doesnt work on Linux dual monitors always shares both your monitors as 1 huge screen (I shouldnt have to apologize for having dual monitors when Im on a call) Im sure all these issues are fixed on Windows (and maybe even Mac) but who cares Those platforms are chock full of apps that work Ppl say lets use slack I hear it works on Linux well it doesnt so lets not  Original Review: (this still counts because of their stupid magic link thing you cant just know your username and password and slack channel name you have to also get email on the platform your trying to login with If you want to login on your phone for example you cant use your desktop email to verify your email address Its so nonintuitive) The most confusing app Ive ever used Spent 15 minutes and still cant login You guys must seriously have meetings about how to make this app difficult to use I use slack on the browser want to use it on the phone this app does not give me that ability,1
182,Update ruins interface for me It used to be I can open slack and be right where I left off Now I have to swipe to get back to my conversation Ill still use it because I have no choice but honestly it takes more effort to use this interface than the previous one Also why the bottom home dm ECT ribbon Pointless takes up more screen space and I could easily just choose what I want from the list like before It used to be I could bring this up when I wanted Now there is no choice,2
183,I have been using this for groups who text in Spanish for politics or to help people struggling during the pandemic We connect them with programs  grants that may help them I can only use programs that other people design Its complicated We get 300 names  phones from public records If someone needs an electric bill paid I find the answer that someone has programmed check a box to send the correct information or forms  Ive helped people connect with what they need,1
184,Recently this app has been very buggy on mobile and OSx Moreso than usual On Android it forces you to sign out of some workspaces unless you click on others first and then circle back and try again Its like some kind of weird cookie and timing problem If I had not been using slack for years I would be very concerned As it is I am accustomed to this nonsense but I still want to call it out in case firsttime users are experiencing this,2
185,App is terrible does not let you log in Sends you an email to confirm the device but does not load on device Terrible app 10 out 10 do not recommend,1
186,Notifications dont work Randomly either dont show up or flash up momentarily and then vanish Even worse the app sets the message as read so I cant see which channel it came from Multiple times a day I have to manually cycle through all my channels to see what Ive missed Getting notifications on the phone breaks the entire tracking system Amazing Slack cant figure out a problem solved by every other messaging app I use Seems they dont think its their problem,1
187,Ive had problems getting notifications since our company started using slack Ive dealt with the notification issues This latest design is just not thought through If Im on my phone I want it to function like the rest of my phone This is just a mess UX innovation is great but only when its intuitive,2
188,The Android app is absolutely useless Push notifications seem to have a mind of their own They almost never come on time and some of them show up minshours after Ive already read the message in app The worst part is that new messages dont show up even when I have the app open and pull down to refresh I open the Mac and see that I have unread messages from hours ago that never showed up in app Im really surprised and dismayed at how terrible Slacks Android app has become,1
189,this app kinda sucks it will randomly stop making sounds and vibrate only when you get a message then just completely stop sending notifications causing you to miss important messages i checked my phones notification settings and the apps notification settings and all were on yet i still received no notifications had to uninstall and reinstall for it to properly work again i use this for work and if i dont know im being messaged or tagged it can completely screw up my day,1
190,New app is absolutely horrible The inappropriate use of swipe (now for navigation instead of specific functions) cause you to have to try 345 times to long press anything as it always thinks youre swiping App defaults to channel list instead of most recent conversation Notifications dont work right anymore Blown away that everything was made harder to use instead of easier,1
191,Just auto updated to newest version It is awful If I didnt have to use it for work Id delete it The ease of use/functionality has been removed in place of something that forces you to navigate between what you want to look at and everything else You had a great UI before why change what didnt need fixing,1
192,Pulled support from android seemingly without any good reason I can now open the app and tell I have messages waiting but no way to read or respond to them,1
193,This app is awful It frequently will just give up and never update Ill see there are unread messages in a channel but when I go to the channel theres nothing there Then on another device I can see the messages Or sometimes I will select a channel and Ill just see a blank screen no buttons no text no loading indicator nothing for a solid minute before it updates This has been going on for at least a year I do not believe this app will ever be good I have wifi turned on at home,1
194,Notifications frequently do not show up I had to set a periodic alarm to check for new posts DMs and chats are listed alphabetically on the home page not chrono If you want to see them chrono you have to tap a different page If you read a message in the app or through the web without tapping the notification on your phone the notification stays One more little thing: when youre done typing the back arrow in the top left does not go back It closes the keyboard first,2
195,This app is really good for teamwork I have used it on both phone and computer to have access to my chats at all time The only problem I have so far on the mobile version is app inability to share video There is an option to share photos and other files but not video The only way to share a video is from gallery its 2020 and most apps are capable of this,4
196,Latest big revision involves swiping between screens and whenever I try to tap something it registers it as a tiny swipe instead of a selection I have to tap super lightly to make sure my finger doesnt contact more than a pinpoint on the screen Did no one use the app before it was released Also messages seem to get lost  I get multiple notifications for incoming messages but can only find one of them when I open the app So frustrating,1
197,After the slack team pointed out how to change the back button/gesture behavior the app has become immensely more usable and I propose that the toggle for this should be set to channel list by default and allow user to select exit if they want to (but who would want that anyway) Gets the job done if you get your settings and configurations just right Still no match to the desktop app,4
198,I fell in love with Slack at my workplace over the past couple of years where we use it all the time The most important thing to keep in mind about Slack is that you cant expect it to be just another messaging app  it is much more than that  it is more like a communication and sharing platform built around messaging When you combine Slack with other apps some amazingly powerful things can happen The Android app is very close to the desktop app experience unlike many mobile apps that are often weak when compared to their desktop version Many of the negative reviews seen here are based on poor connectivity having nothing to do with Slack or resulting from ignorance of the Slack features that allow amazing control over everything including notifications for each channel and availability Once you understand what Slack is you probably wont complain about what it isnt The Slack team does a great job of adding features over time that are logical extensions of what is already there without breaking anything,4
199,This app has been giving me issues for over a month now I can no long interact on it Ill see a message notification but when I open the app to respond it tells me that my work space is unavailable This is very frustrating and slows down my productivity I hate having to open my laptop just to reply to slack because the app on my phone is a malfunctioning waste of space I would like a solution asap,1
200,I hate this app Notifications sometimes take forever to get It is super annoying as a workplace tool I have to be subscribed to like 10 channels and get notifications 24 hrs a day I cant keep track of what is going on This needs to be streamlined somehow to make it less busy Maybe have channels people cant reply to or something The whole app could easily be replaced with texting and phone calls Kind of a waste of time,1
201,Best workplace messaging app point blank period Others create silos where slack destroys them Calling has gotten better but still not their strong suite Would be nice in a pinch Which is where I find myself from time to time Seriously I love being able to keep an eye on all of my areas of interest and be available for my team and have it not feel intrusive Theres a reason these guys are number 1,4
202,Was good Then suddenly updated and boom: all my productivity goes out the window with a new design that is much less intuitive and less efficient than before Poor design decisions abound throughout and constant swiping is now required Hate it when companies decide that they can just change the product I paid for after the fact ,2
203,The app is a little awkward If I start a conversation in the desktop version the last few messages in the convo are not always shown in the app That makes it difficult to switch from the desktop to the app if I need to continue my convo on my phone That may be a problem with my wifi connection but I havent seen a way to refresh where it will sych with the desktop chat history,3
204,The consistent issues with this app for the past 34 months has been pretty bad Examples: my drafts dont work I cant edit a draft message when I click the text field it takes me to a new message My groups I organize my messages in doesnt save on the app from when I make edits on the desktop Ive had to reinstall the app 4 times because it lasts for days without updating Proper notifications dont come through and I dont see messages HUNDREDS of times over the past few months,2
205,Its a big hassle to navigate the layout especially in opening various chats Im part of Nonintuitive layout/navigation Also not sure if this has online storage (which I would really like to avoid using all my phone storage) Additionally if you have a Slack account with any given email and you delete that Slack account you can create a new Slack account with the same email right,2
206,I would have had a five star rating before the most recent update I did not update for about 3 months but I decided to update about a week ago and have been having such a bad experience I think there might be some sort of memory leak because about 30 seconds into having the app open things start to slow down exponentially to the point that you have to wait 30 seconds from when you actually tap on the text input field before the keyboard shows up and you can start typing Unusable,1
207,This design SUCKS I dont want the main panel to be a long list of TEXT names of channels and people This does not facilitate quickly navigating conversations I also need to be able to quickly switch between conversations without going back to this HORRENDOUS main page of TEXT names Unbelievable I can see this being the start of Slacks decline all because some idiot had the idea to fix a brilliant design that was never broke Not ok the app constantly freezes and crashes my phone now,1
208,Idk what happened but the last update made the app lag crash and delay notifications by hours Sometimes I cant even type or read a message it lags so bad Before the update 5 stars But until it gets fixed 1 for sure Its that unusable Ive resorted to going to the web app on my phone Yikes,1
209,You KNOW your new UI is bad when you have to include a tutorial that explains how to use it to someone whos been using your app for years I happen to think the new design is also ugly but thats just my opinion Usability is undeniably worse so its no surprise to see that other recent reviews seem to reflect that And after trying to use it for a day Im also already noticing the slowness and endless loading screens that other users are reporting I thought Slack had better QA than this,1
210,Since the update it SUCKS Like the others swipe to move between conversations It was there before the update now its the only option Come on think before removing things because you think it might be better I cant even downgrade to the better interface because it doesnt have an option to remove updates Smooth move folks,2
211,This was a good app but all of a sudden there is a major issue with it and my S8+ It doesnt ever notify me when I have been pinged I have to open the app and see if anyone has reached out to me which isnt ok if Im away This is definitely some kind of update issue as everything else has been checked on including Slack tech support Whatever you guys did fix it,2
212,Notifications suddenly stopped working even when turning off batteryrelated optimizations for the slack app Also the / button is gone so I have to hunt for it on the Android keyboard and my particular setup does have the / in an easy to access location I still like slack for chatting with my friend groups and family,2
213,This app worked great until I updated it today 4/24/20 It wouldnt let me in the app at all (animated logo with no end in sight) until I pressed on the app icon and went to jump to and typed in my channel that is the only way to access it my workspace is all messed up no channels that Im a part of listed it keeps saying offline and so I hit the refresh type of button and it goes away but not for long this app is totally messed up now 1 star Update: works as expected now5 stars,1
214,I am greatly disappointed with the new mobile apps navigation After the recent updates to the desktop I had high hopes for a great new mobile app Having to swipe contently to get around is quite about for me I am sure there are many who will love the new design I just wish slack had a option to pick between the two interfaces,2
215,Latest update cluttered the UI significantly and made it difficult to use The latest update also broke message sending My messages now fail to send each time no matter how many times I tap them to attempt to resend I tried submitting a feedback message and it also failed to send Previous versions of the app were fantastic  hopefully these issues are resolved soon,1
216,Lately when I see a highlighted channel and tap it sometimes it doesnt show the new message in the app even though there is one The channel remains highlighted and theres nothing I can do to refresh it to get it to show the message Very inconvenient for a product my job uses I just have to get on a computer or wait until the app decides to show the message Force closing the app as restarting it doesnt work either Please fix it ,2
217,Works great But the new version took away the ability to mute for 1 24 hours etc Now you can only turn then on or off If I dont want to be botherd with a channel I have to remember to turn it back on Please bring back the other options again I hope it still mutes my PC when I mute the phone Have not checked that yet,3
218,[Update 5/26/20: Problem appears to be fixed Thanks Slack] Navigation look feel and basic usage all are fine Biggest issue for me is that the latest update made uploading photos take so long For some reason on my Pixel 2 XL when I go to select a photo it takes a ridiculously long time to show the photos in the upload gallery Not sure if this is a common issue,3
219,The redesign for the Slack app made the app worse to use Although gestures have been adjusted the most recent update broke the ability to quickly and easily flick from left edge to access channels and workspaces Now said behavior scrolls the chat on phones with curved displays especially Theres not much in terms of Preferences to turn off or disable this The same feature has also caused reacting to messages to be harder (gesture takes over as a swipe despite a quick tap),2
220,Im not getting any notifications on one of my companies channels It was working before just fine I left the channel and rejoined and it worked for a day and then stopped sending notifications again for that specific channel The rest of the channels are sending notifications fine I have all channels set up to get notifications How can I fix this Thank you for your response I was able to troubleshoot my android and everything appeared fine How do I run the notificaitons troubleshoot test on my desktop Thats where the issue is thanks,1
221,Ive been using slack for years However over the past several months their quality has decreased as the outage time has increased Theres been at least 5 sizable outages in the past few months which have severely impacted our teams communications at a time where digital communication is more important than ever Its been extremely frustrating and has not been proactively addressed by Slack I would recommend looking elsewhere,2
222,In general it is a good app But once you open it with a certain passwordas I did accidentally on my phone linking with previous work but not my current workplaceId like to relog in using my Google connections to the current work But Slack keeps sending me back to the previous version I havent managed to log out of the phone version so far although I am able to use the correct one on my laptop It would help a lot if I could easily merge the phone one Thanks,3
223,Android TV  Tablet not easy to use I am using Odroid running Android 9 and this app is difficult if not unusable to switch workspaces Adding an existing is even more difficult Threads side bar once opened cant be closed or controls are invisible App starts in portrait then rotates constantly and is ill formatted for 1920 by 1080 with keyboard and mouse as input device This is typical of most Android applications but someone needs to reconize this Streaming devices are often TV HDMI,2
224,Last update KILLED THE APP Were having SO MANY issues every morning with conference calls People in my team had so many issues with the iOS app now Android is now on par with iOS with the latest update The volume output on speaker is now SUPER low Some users are muted and cant ever unmute God damn slack please step up your game You went from a perfectly working app to something completely unreliable in your last update,1
225,Mobile notifications which is probably the biggest reason to use this app are absolutely horrible More often than not I get notifications for messages that I read hours before I rarely get notifications on time Other people in my company have experienced the same thing We all just ended up turning notifications off because theyre so bad,1
226,Inconsistent Sometimes I get messages right away sometimes not If my desktop app is open not necessarily foreground but minimized my mobile doesnt receive notifications As of the last few months a more annoying issue has risen: I will get a notification on mobile tap it in the notification tray and the channel to which I go does not show the new message Not until I reset cache can I see the new messages This is a daily occurrence,2
227,My messages keep disappearing while Im writing them and not only are they not saved but there is no saved drafts or archived option anywhere in the entire app menus or preferences The instructions in support for this issue or as close to it as I could find direct me to menu options which do not exist in the app I installed Tedious And I have to use slack for a committee Im on,1
228,Notifications not working properly Images show up as a black tile in gallery when trying to attach half the time When typing in username to send message to someone new I click on their name and nothing happens and it doesnt make a new thread Only way for a new thread is to find one of their previous messages in another group /channel and then clicking send message,1
229,SUPER responsive devs  replied within a day and fixed the problem If youre having trouble adding workspaces do as they recommend in their reply Works like a charm and you do NOT lose what you already have Thanks again (Was: Cannot add a 9th workspace Crashes dead 100% of the time S10+ Its great for the current workspaces but I really need to add one),5
230,we use this app for our organization and it works greatmost of the time Recently I have been having major issues however My messages will randomly disappear after I have posted them very frustrating Sometimes a message also appears to post twice but then *usually* corrects to only having sent once after closing and reopening the app Please fix,3
231,Only one issue but big usability goof Starred channels with unread messages show up in same list with unstarred with unreads The whole point of starring channels is to see important unread messages amongst the flood of stuff you usually dont care about The mobile app kills that feature that is present in desktop app Big drop on the part of slack Otherwise great stable front end for slack,3
232,The app is completely unreliable sending notifications I only see messages came in when I look for them For a tool used in business getting critical messages hours after theyre sent is useless Likewise randomly checking the app often enough to get them is a waste of time I dont have Pretty embarrassing for the company who thinks theyll be the end of email,1
233,I have been using slack for a couple of months and it has worked fine The only problem is that I dont get notified when I get a new message and I turn the notifications ON and all the settings are right but it does not work The same happens to my team I send messages and they dont get the notification So you have to be constantly checking to see if you have any messages and that is very annoying My team and I have missed meetings because we never received a notification PLEASE FIX,3
234,The most difficulty messaging app ever In this day and age it should be stupid simple to message between coworkers this is not its easy just to use our phone messaging service that guess what  we are already paying for so why pay for another keep it Its worthless,1
235,Doesnt load new messages/update when new messages are posted It will notify you of new message and when you click on the notification it takes you to the channel but none of the new messages are loaded Only fix is to completely exit the app and relaunch every new channel post Horrible Also if you go from 4g to wifi any messages during network change never come through So you miss important messages and look like the class idiot for not knowing details that the rest of the team know,1
236,The new update is really buggy I get notifications for new messages but when I click on the notification it goes to the channel but doesnt show the message Non of the new messages are showing up and the bold indicator of the channel wont go away Very annoying since I dont have access to my laptop right now,1
237,Unreliable Ive been playing with the notification settings for two weeks Ive tried every configuration I still do not get notification for some message and Ill get them for other cant stand this app I will be pushing to stop using it at work until the notification system is more reliable,1
238,App worked wonderfully for a long time until today When I try to open it the system shows me Unfortunately Slack has stopped Is this because if an update Im using an old device from 2013 so it may be outdated but if this is the reason please make it more accessible Thank you Will edit to 5 stars if this issue is fixed,4
239,Since the new update (March 18) Im regularly having the same problem that Pratik Shetty mentioned below in the reviews  Im using a mobile version on Samsung Galaxy Tab A and the back and home buttons for the Tablet screen overlay Slacks new message field As a result I try to type a new message and the app collapses  Frustrating to say the least given that my tablet is the main way I use Slack,1
240,Unfortunately it just feels like theyre trying so hard to make it userfriendly that it takes all power out of the users hands I feel like I cant do anything Trying to connect multiple accounts between my computer and phone is an awful process The magic links that get sent to my email dont sign me in automatically I cant tell which accounts are connected to which email and there is no easy way to find that out Customizing servers as an admin is impossible Used the app for 4 years,1
241,The icon redesign is a tremendous eyesore more fit to be the face of a pharmaceutical firm and they didnt put any extra effort into making the app on any of the platforms leaving gaps in design No dark mode no voip no collapsing the sidebar on ios or windows I use it because my friends do,4
242,Dont rely on the apps notifications for anything important I got an 8:55 slack message about my 9:00 meeting being in a different place and the notification came through at 9:45 after the meeting was already over Often I dont get any notifications for messages at all,1
243,I use the app constantly and find it adequate for most messaging tasks However it has a few fundamental problems that make it difficult to use as constantly as I need it First it stores an inordinate amount of data (Im at 1gb currently) second the user search functionally is pretty bad it doesnt match complete input so even when typing a full username I still must scroll to find a recipient (my org has 200k users) third it fails to properly upload shared files most times,3
244,The app suddenly started crashing and not responding A LOT Chews through battery And a feature they used to have has been gone for a while: auto clearing Android notifications once you view a message on desktop All in all an app that started out AMAZING two or so years ago has gotten worse to the point of me literally being unable to use it due to the app being unresponsive and crashing,1
245,Yikes there are some serious issues here Ill have notifications of new messages but they wont actually show up When I do see the new messages they dont get marked as read These are the bare minimum requirements of a messaging app (I wouldnt even call them features) and theyre busted These issues have been present for months,1
246,Update: everything is now resolved and there are no current issues I find it easy to navigate and add spaces to It works exactly like the desktop IMO I finally received a job offer since last July and they use Slack I cannot get it to even open All I am able to see is a white screen I cant leave my computer anymore because I will miss notifications so I have to constantly check in all day/night long,5
247,If you are sending a one time login link via email you need to take into account that most good businesses will prescan all incoming URLs which means your one Time link wont work when its actually received How is this not taken into account for a business app Also had bad problems with sending images If image upload fails then you cant just cancel and resend was not working Had to uninstall app to clear the stuck resend which is pinned to the bottom and doesnt scroll away Fix it,1
248,I was on vacation Aug 716 and was only viewing slacks (not responding) Now that Im back to work Im experiencing the same issue everyone else is noting I cannot type because my slack lags and takes a long time to actually show what I typed My email and texts and even this review is not experiencing the same issue This is having a huge impact on my productivity and Id imagine others as well Can there be a rollback to the previous version which wasnt experiencing this issue,1
249,Works at a basic level but is buggy compared to iOS and Windows versions of the app Sensitivity for sliding left and right between levels of conversation is inconsistent (not sensitive enough) which funnily enough is the opposite issue from the last update Notifications will occasionally fail to come through and indications that someone else is typing sometimes dont show when they should or show when they shouldnt Could be better and is lacking compared to other messaging apps,3
250,Ive used Slack for a little over a year and Ive enjoyed it But this newest update has killed it the new interface is terrible and forced swiping isnt that great Now its hard to click to comment or emoji because the app thinks Im trying to swipe I have to long press in order to do anything which gets clunky after a while,2
251,Since the latest update major features no longer work I constantly have to uninstall and reinstall the app to get some features to function It is difficult to reply to messages because my home screen buttons cover the message box The 3 dot menu doesnt function at all so I cannot set my status or change my preferences Sometimes I cannot even select a channel to talk in It is the only app that I have trouble with on my tablet,1
252,I dont know how you could roll out a new UI with so many bugs and issues I can barely use my phone app right now and I cant trust it to get or send messages in real time Its not like Im doing complicated things on Slack These things are the basic backbone of the system: sending and receiving messages It sucks to log in on the desktop and see that my phone app just wasnt loading new threads Fix the Android App,1
253,Edit: 2 months later and still having same issue listed below Also scrolling through messages to find older messages is cumbersome Sometimes the app forces me bach to most recent messages so I have to scroll back to older messages again Good app Only thing is that sometimes after sending a message a blank space shows up but the text doesnt appear unless I tap it,2
254,Lately a few bugs I am trying to see if my version is updated I use this for work and its vital that I can communicate through it Lately I have noticed that in one of my dms with the manager and supervisor even when they use my name same way as always I am not being notified of the new message It was not a good situation It is happening intermittently with this one group dm,3
255,Im a long time slack user and have generally been delighted by it However this version is completely unreliable and barely usable It has hard crashed my phone twice in the last day and Im not doing anything out of the ordinary There are some severe mobile usability issues that need to be addressed,1
256,Im not even receiving any of the messages or notifications for anything anymore And I have not done anything different with my phone since I started using it I will be lucky if I get any order notifications currently And its so laggy from when I receive an order notification from when I actually get the order can be from instant to 10 minutes later,1
257,I updated the app a couple of days ago It worked fine before Now the emoji that are responses to messages randomly disappear and reappear The emoji picker is slow to load partially blocked and difficult to close (as a double backspace no longer works) I regret updating Edit: Almost a month later these problems have not been fixed,1
258,I guess it works but it feels clunky Lack of ability to view shared screens is a major mark against considering the competition (and webcams even work now so its not like video isnt something that cant be done in this very app) Nor is there an ability to synchronise an app connection with a desktop connection (for the screen sharing) so I end up appearing twice on calls Also a recent update took away the option to switch audio sources on calls so to use my bluetooth headset I need to turn it off and turn it back on again FOR EVERY CALL That pushes the experience down to unpleasant,3
259,I get the people running the app need money to keep it running but limiting messages to only be seen for a month no group calls/video calls (and then even limiting the number of people who can join in the 699 monthly plan) and limiting what permissions people can have/get/give was not it chief You can do all this and MORE with Discord If youre a company I suggest using something else unless you want to give 1299$ a month for these things that are free on Discord,1
260,Dont like the fact it force downloads media notifications into my storage You can delete them but theyre always back the next day UPDATE = got contacted by the slack team who said they would look into seeing why they download never heard backand after opening my music player today I was greeted with 30 more unwanted notifications Uninstalled because I literally cant take it anymore,1
261,I really like slack however I have a Samsung se 10 (I think) and recently the app has been freezing hard core or the screen stutter/shakes I figured this would be the best way to alert the developers It used to work fine and in a timely manner but now its almost unusable I constantly have to switch to my iPad or computer to use which is fine when Im home but inconvenient when Im not I see theres a long line of Samsung users here experiencing this issue too Plz fix,2
262,Whatever was in the update on Oct 23 it has caused massive problems The app consistently freezes Sometimes everything goes blank and sometimes you can see your last channel and the chat but everything is still locked Cant even scroll up and down in the chat channel you can see Android device most recent OS using Samsung Tab A 2020 model 11/9/2020 I should have noted that the only solution ended up requiring a complete uninstall and new installation Ive done that 3x,1
263,Update 6/2021 Now with firewall allowing slack I still cant pull channels What is being used besides Google play services Something is being blocked 7/2000 No offline use is ridiculous No notifications of messages found out they break it on purpose until you update to newest app Annoying way to force an update Yes miss critical business messages and look clueless Thanks Still same issue when theres an update to install they break notifications so you are forced to install,1
264,Mobile Push Notifications are Hit or Miss I have used this app for years but the main problem is inconsistencies with push notifications Ive had channels have notifications that did not alert me that had responses minutes after I switched to another app and were still not alerting me 30 minutes later Also if you have your desktop app/page for slack open it also affects your mobile notifications sometimes either very late or not at all Really bad because 99% use this for business,2
265,Great app for communication My biggest struggle with the app is the notifications are abusive Ill look at my phone notification bar and its constantly bouncing around because slack channels have conversations going My solution I mute the app for a few hours just so I can look at my notifications The notifications for this app need to be made less needy static and not constantly adjusting because a conversation is going on,4
266,LatelyThe app has been Horrible Sometimes the notifications come in sometimes they dont When you check the new messages the app doesnt update You have to close the app and reopen it to see those new messages Update: thank you for responding Feel free to update your comment once the bug has been fixed,1
267,Removed a star Issue below might be fixed but since notifications rarely work it is hard to tell Mobile app suffers from an updating issue Often will receive a notification that a new message has arrived but clicking on the notification will bring up the appropriate channel without the new message(s) Is necessary to actually close the app and reopen to get the message(s) to show Have heard same complaint from other users Difficult to find inapp feedback option is pretty much useless,1
268,Dang The new design is a big step backwards for Slack Over the past few years using Slack has gone from quick and easy to slow and burdensome and Ive gone from ardent advocate to reluctant user I hope the Slack team considers their long time customer base and our use cases when they reevaluate this design,5
269,Normally I think slack is a great app but in the last 24 hours it has become completely unusable for any extended period of time If I kill it and start fresh I can get maybe a message out before it completely slows down and becomes unresponsive Sometimes channel rendering and navigation just freeze at a loading view and other times the keyboard becomes borderline impossible to use Very frustrating,1
270,Seems to fulfill all my needs What I like most though is that the development team writes proper changelog entries for every new release and that the customer support is really responsive and helpful I wish all app developers would follow their example,4
271,Latest update totally sucks The new UI is plain awful Cant you idiots just leave well enough alone Stop messing with everything trying to optimize my experience Slack used to be so much nicer than its competitors because it kept things simple and easy to use Now its starting to feel like the Facebook app where doing anything takes 10 clicks and I have to search around endlessly for simple things like chat I bet theres some fool VP who thinks Feeds are magical and that your magical AI systems know more about what I want than I do You suck at your jobs,1
272,The app has become nearly unusable in the past couple weeks If I open the app from a notification itll freeze before it even loads the messages If I manage to get messages to load the app will become unresponsive as I scroll through a channel especially if new messages are coming into the channel (Using Google Pixel 4),1
273,I consistently see notifications for messages that when I click through dont show in app The notification engine serves more up to date data then than the app Really not productivity evening App is enerally clunky with communicating and runs slow (might be because Im on a pixel 1) App really just ok for reading messages and I have to rely on notifications to read those since they wont show in the app even when Im on wifi Love slack overall really dont like this app,2
274,Sucks so bad I came to Googs Play to post this Slow AF I post several comments / images at a time because it seems it freezes but its actually working There is no notification thatthe app is indded working Serious lag Of course I have to suffer through this because Slack is the interrupter of choice Stop the bloat and speed it up Slackers,1
275,Edited This is now fixed I think it was a change on the windows app maybe but this just started working correctly The team also put specific content on Android settings that also helped but i am now getting notifications and my dev team likes me (a bit) more Old review: Need help with Oreo and Notifications I dont think your Android app team gets how to keep the app sending notifications in Oreo given features to reduce battery consumption My dev team hates that I dont get their notifications if I am not at my desk but Slack seems to always be shut down on my Oneplus 3T on Oreo I have tried every setting I can find online to keep Slack awake but it never seems to fix the issue I really need this resolved as it is hurting productivity when my team is blocked on approvals or requirements from me,3
276,near as I can tell the only reason to use this app is Im on mobile and the people Im working with dont want to use Discord I like all my friends that insist on using this service a little less for making me use this its broken you cant even upload your own animated gifs and have them be animated I am taking on faith that its more useful on desktop,3
277,Near completely stagnant development for over a year possible more than two and the first major change is just ugly genetic looking new logo for the sake of change and giving lots of money to some random design firm All companies I work with switched to other options already except one that uses free Edit: Other phone accidentally got updated to the new logo version New UI color scheme looks like they picked random colors as some dont work like dark grey on dark purple,1
278,I used to have little to no problems with slack but now Im missing messages most of my chats wont load and I cant search key words Its not my connection its the app I dont know what happened but this has made my job incredibly difficult I know some of the crew members I work with have a lot of the same issues Please fix your app its not a game I can just delete Its required for me to do my job and Im getting in trouble because of these bugs,1
279,So frustrating Theres no way to set your status or availability from the Android app The only thing you can do is go in and out of DND You cant set a status icon or status message Even worse Slacks own help pages give directions that dont match the app It tells you to tap the threedot button and then tap Set Status There is no Set Status option in that menu Was it removed,1
280,Slack continues to create bizarre design decisions that reduce usability Recent change makes clicking a slack workspace image now do the same thing as clicking the 3 dots instead of it going to the workspace If I wanted to click the 3 dots Id click that Dont make the far left target do the same thing as the right one Horrible UX,1
281,Giving it 4 stars just cause the last update messed up the fragment back stack If you drill down to many conversations and press back you have to literally press back for every conversation you just went through which can be pretty annoying if you are used to exiting apps via the back button and not the home Great to see more apps making use of the bottom bar for navigation though,4
282,There is an issue when I open the app Sometimes I only see a white page with the big logo in the middle and get stuck at there without entering the app Its been persistent for a few days Please double check with the dev team This is pretty annoying My phone is Gal note 10 plus and the app is up to date,3
283,Blah what a nuisance SLACK can be and I have to use this app for work Its great for keeping communications for specific projects together and being highly searchable (which it should be since SLACK means Searchable Log of All Conversations and Knowledge) but the notifications can (at times) be as annoying a Reply All email conversation (which isnt entirely SLACKs fault) Also maybe its my companies security policy but SLACK will sign me out randomly and signing back in is a hassle,2
284,Bricks Phone Out of the blue the app started draining my HTC U11 battery freezes when open I cant type in it I have too close and reopen to see new messages Its just not functional at all Drains my battery at a rate of 1% every 45 seconds to a minute Uninstalling because this isnt viable Slack is also required for work so yay,1
285,Hello Slack team Here are some bugs 1 Push notifications are arriving after Ive read the messages 2 Sometimes new messages in channels are not showing up I have to close the app and reopen it in order to get the new messages 3 After catting with someone if I got back to the users list page the red notification number keeps showing against that user whose chat I just closed,1
286,Unusable Android App  you go to sign in and a button that you have to press comes up that says This requires an Update through PlayStore When you press Update Now it just brings you back to the install page that only has the options of uninstall and open Rinse and repeat Utterly unusable You cant sign in because you have to update first but then it wont update,1
287,This app is really easy and there are so many different things to do Its so easy to find your channel or the person youre talking to privately or even a group of people You can even customize your own emojis and put them into slack but thats a lot more difficult You can do calls and video calls You can put different profile pictures and tell people what you like to do I really think this app is easy and practical to use,5
288,Cant even connect using different internet connections in different areas of my city Ive tried using the magic link signing in manually putting in the workspace url manually Always get hit with Something went wrong Please try again Ill be using the iOS version on my iPad until this is fixed,1
289,this new update has made it so I no longer get easy access to the notifications messages on my lock screen are still visible but when I touch them to go directly to the message it doesnt do that and just puts them on read so when I have to go into the app to find the full message I dont even know what channel it came from because those are no longer emboldened either reactionary emojis arent visible anymore either Ive never had this issue with this before until the update,3
290,It doesnt work Ive tried signing in and having them seems me a magic link for months Ive never once ever been able to sign into the app First it says incorrect password (Is not incorrect Its the same as my desktop Slack password) Then it says an error has occurred Ive never once been able to log in,1
291,Use slack all all day every day but the android app is getting notably more buggy First started getting a bug where Id open the app and the conversation would be scrolled back 50 or so messages More recently half the time I open the app I cant interact with it until I close and reopen it Sometimes I get both bugs at the same time Additionally the user experience is lacking Channels with messages shift up in the list after a second Also channel naming doesnt allow hyphens on mobile,2
292,I would like to remove the Unread group feature It makes it hard to locate the channel Im looking for as I have to look through two lists instead of one Whats more Unread appears before Starred which kind of defeats the purpose of Starred as I have to scroll down a long list of Unread to get to the Starred list Showing Unread Starred first doesnt help I would like to see Starred list first no matter what channel has Unreads Unread messages are not important Starred channels are,2
293,Please allow slack to work without google play services Reliable Message delivery needs to be looked into Occasional problems receiving messages(even not optimized) Font sizes Seems like an awesome app but please look into a way to keep the app running and ensure messages are delivered instantly(without google play services would be great)  Thanks for the effort,4
294,Worked well for about a month then it began to have problems connecting The network connection is not the problem since I am able to browse without a problem No it no longer connects even reinstalled the app No success,1
295,The app doesnt recognize when you read messages so I always have tons of red notifications until I go to my desktop and reread them there Its frustrating because I keep thinking I have new messages and dont Also the push notifications do not work even though I enabled them on mobile and through the desktop app Seems like slack is either slacking on mobile totally or focusing on iOS,2
296,There is no way a company of Slacks size and stature should have released a product this buggy Its clearly untested on Android tablets Menu items dont work channels always appears when switching to the app no matter what you were on before and channels is empty no notifications on DMS and tech support will ask you for a screenshot when they could just try it themselves Boo I dont want to reach out to you again Acknowledge the problems in Play and deploy a fix,1
297,The only thing I dont like is how confusing the chats can get if you have a lot of them or how to navigate between multiple work stations Its very useful for my workplace though and Im so glad to have it It saves on awful email chains,4
298,Terrible app so many problems Example  when I go to reply the android navigation buttons are over the text box in portrait mode so clicking in that box just closes the app I was able to work around this by switching to landscape mode but then you cant see what youre writing or the message thread Now also if your phone switches back to portrait in the middle of writing you lose the whole message you just wrote Basically unusable on Android,1
299,I like the app and its channels and such but Im beyond mad that once again APPLE gets more abilities on an app than android I cannot send a video through slack but hey no biggie Apple got it Im a supervisor and it is extremely inconvenient to have your employee do the work for you because I am unable fix it,2
300,I started on Slack like 3 or 4 years ago because my company uses it Ive grown to really like it a lot I only use it for work but I was thinking about it: it seems like a platform like this could easily be used to connect family and friends way better than what Facebook has become I dunno regardless the app is great for a small business team and Id recommend it,3
301,Used to work fine but has recently become extremely sluggish on a Pixel 2 Typing will hang the phone for a few seconds Loading a channel almost takes tens of seconds as does figuring out whos online when the app runs If its helpful for debugging I have several workspaces added to the app,2
302,So far I am not the most pleased with this app I need it for my formula sae club but I cant figure out how to login Most apps use a simple email and password This uses some sort of specific web address that I cant seem to find So now Im logged out of my account and cabt figure out how to get in The emails Ive been sent with the confirmation of my email take me to a blank page so they arent working I would mu h prefer a simple username and password,3
303,Slack disappeared from my app collection when my phone rebooted itself I restored all the old settings and all my apps messages photos etc came back with the exception of Slack I never had a problem with it before but now Im not even able to reinstall it manually Play store gives me a message that they are unable to install Slack I dont know what changed but its crucial to my job that I use Slack for communication so I really need it back Will give more stars when I have it back,1
304,New UI is a security concern When something is shared with you via dm the first part of that persons email address is used to identify them in the notification rather than their name or slack handle This information should not be visible to anyone but administrators of the slack workspace,1
305,I was just reading the other reviews and Brandon is right App worked great until most recent update I have to reset my phone at least 5 times a day just so I can recieve latest messages Very disappointed with the service,1
306,Notifications are super unreliable Instead of the new super ugly UI it would have been nice if I didnt miss notifications all the time Even after multiple reinstalls and making sure all battery optimizations are off still the majority of notifications dont come through,2
307,While I like the app there are few issues that are extremely annoying 1 Why are the categories user created or system default(like Top priority) shown at the end after all channels user is part of are displayed Doesnt top priority mean something This needs to be addressed ASAP 2 It seems like app struggles im adopting tp dark theme at times some sections of the app are light colored while some are system default dark theme mode,3
308,The app seems to jump from one bug to another They squash one and another annoying one pops up Recently when I select an unread channel or DM it takes upwards of 1015 seconds to load the app just hangs there Sometimes unread channels dont actually show unread messages when I select then as well Generally the app has felt unreliable and unstable in the last 6 months,1
309,If you only have a single workspace its kind of ok but the number of presses to switch workspaces is painful Even just allowing the back action to go to the Workspace Selector would be better than having the back action exit the application Separately attaching an image to a message seems to crash Slack constantly Most of the time the pictures dont even load in the selector much less upload to the channel,2
310, service I fixed the problems by removing and reinstalling both the apps and they are working again But how they can go from working to not working within a week is not good Now I have to see if the notifications get fixed Raising rating to 4 stars ====Previous Review ==== Audio not working What the heck Last week my desktop slack stopped working with calls and now my phone Whats going on In addition to all this there heavy use if resources on my laptop and no notifications for new messages sometimes,4
311,In latest build notifications no longer works My co workers and I noticed we no longer get notified of @ messages Uninstall and reinstall did not fix my problem as others have mentioned This is a huge miss in terms of functionality and needs to be fixed,1
312,this is a great work or group app it does still have a few thing that do not work in every location as for the the TEAM that runs this app I GIVE THEM 6 Stars  BECAUSE THEY DO USE OUR POST AND PROBLEMS WITH OUR MODELS OF PHONES EVEN THE CHEEP ONES NOT JUST THE TOP TIER PHONES TO THE TEAM THANK YOU FOR FIXING THE A50 Picture issue,4
313,Notifications for a whole channel just dont show up Every time I open a channel in any workspace the whole screen shakes and I cant do anything No buttons work I cant add a message The only thing I can do is reply to an existing message Its made the app virtually useless,1
314,Although bugs do happen reach out to their feedback and support team to let them know whats going wrong for you Theyre friendly efficient and willing to help in making your Slack experience as smooth as possible Great job on listening to our issues and doing yalls best to fix it Shoutout to Lauran for assisting me with my bug issue <3,4
315,Getting worse for power users The new menu that pops up for / commands is really annoying I want to disable it but I cant I know the / commands available to me I do not need a menu especially a menu that is not a typical auto complete but instead blocks you from hitting enter when you finish writing your command meaning you have to actively hit the send button Remove this feature or make it optional It is poor Product decisions that lack user testing that kill the usability of an app,2
316,This app is horrendous I cant get it to load on my OnePlus 9 Pro All it does it say it cant connect to one of my slack servers and freezes before saying invalid authentication Force close and the same thing happens all over again Supposedly you can dismiss the unable to connect to server message but the UI is skewed and the buttons dont work Please fix,1
317,When this app is installed on my phone if I am using bluetooth and wifi disconnects it causes the bluetooth to disconnect too I have to manually go into my settings and toggle it After uninstalling the app the problem was fixed but happened again when I reinstalled it Please fix this,1
318,LOVE THIS APP Totally recomend slack We use it for communicating with our whole extended family  way better than tons of group chats Annoyed when someone switches topics before you where done asking questions We use the different channels for different topics which is truly game changing Also you can start threads  react to messages  awesome,5
319,Often I will get a notification for an update in a channel but when I navigate to a channel it refuses to refresh The lack of manual refresh makes this more annoying Recently when browsing the and mentions tab I will get an error when trying to dive into a message or thread sorry an error has occurred with no suggestions to help Really just seems like an okay app that couldnt handle the load of a ton more people wfh this past year,2
320,Having the same issue as other Android users I was logged out somehow and its impossible to log back in Help,1
321,Dropping support for Android 7 With the supply chain problems we cant just run out and constantly buy new devices just to run Slack Since we cant upgrade android well stop using Slack It was cool otherwise My company uses it but it suddenly wont work on my android 70 tablet in September for no real reason other than some artificial constraints around support,2
322,Annoying bug: when going through attached photos its impossible to get out The back key on the phone does not work and no interface buttons help either The only way to get out of it is to switch app and kill it Miserable experience for an otherwise average app,1
323,App is extremely unreliable I use it for business and it routinely will crash when switching channels Once that happens the app will enter a startup crash loop App works fine for the desktop but for Android it is highly HIGHLY unreliable and crash prone at least for me,2
324,Update: May 2021: App appears to be working fine now Star rating moved from 2 to 5 Old: App currently not very useable on tablet App worked fine until a week or so ago 1 Hiting notificationa brings up white screen instead of the channel/msg the notification belonged Have to click the top peft and then manually choose a space then go locate the message 2 Cant use the react icons on messages but if someome else used one you can click it Cant long press on things,2
325,The Android App is extremely buggy and barely usable after the latest update I constantly miss threads notifications and have to clear cache constantly to mark things as read I logged a bug with support and havent had a resolution in 3 weeks The Android app is useless The basics arent working,1
326,This app is so bad at doing the one thing its supposed to do notify you of msgs It doesnt notify me if I dont open the app first and leave it in the background and it will continue to spam me with notifications for msgs I have not only already read but REPLIED TO and the notifications always come in in the wrong order Absolute garbage,1
327,All the mobile and desktop features that I have used work wonderfully except in the mobile app every time I try to use the Disco feature the app crashes When I reopen from the crash all features are grayed out and inaccessible Ive tried uninstalling/reinstalling 3 separate instances but the problem persists,2
328,The redundancy and issues fraught within the application itself are abundant They havent fixed quite a bit of issues or added common features over the time of its entire existence I would add that the way they fix issues are pretty weak and would hope to see more coming out of a commercially enterprise service,3
329,Not getting notifications I use Slack for work I cannot find a setting in Slack that will send me a notification (auditory and visual) every time there is a group message sent I miss messages because I dont hear my phone go off and this affects my performance at work Im extremely frustrated by this the option to get notified every time immediately does not exist No matter how nice the interface I still cannot call this app functional This needs to be fixed as soon as possible,2
330,Update: this issue has been fixed a bit after the original comment So changing it to 5 stars Something happened recently Already read messages are not getting cleared and new messages are not showing up,1
331,Notifications are awful Our organization moved away from using Slack because of it Too many missed messages if i have Slack open on a computer but havent seen the messages i dont get a notification on my phone and miss it entirely I really tried to push to continue using Slack but this was a deal breaker,1
332,The app would be great except they dont have their notifications thing figured out It has been like this for months where I keep getting notifications over and over again for the same message It refuses to sync up between the phone and the webapp I dont need my phone vibrating non stop for the 28 messages I have already read,2
333,The App works OK The screen sometimes freezes but the problem goes away on cancelling then reopening,3
334,In this day and age there is no reason NOT to have Dark Mode or a Black Theme for a chat app Bad design overall UPDATE: Thanks for the reply Dark Mode now shows up after following your instructions Now please bring it to PC to save our retinas Review rating updated I still have issues with font size I would love to be able to change the font size,2
335,Why cant I sort Slack channels by most recently updated While its possible to sort Slack channels by creation date and highlight unread messages thats not good enough Especially when your workspace has 100s of channels several of which are relevant to your day to day work and you need to refer to a message someone sent earlier today but dont know which of 20+ channels it could be in Aside from this Slack is a great communication tool and great way to keep in touch,4
336,Recently stopped showing peoples online status when the app is left open in the background for a while I have to close the app and reopen it to get statuses to update when this happens Im not sure if it was the latest app update or my latest phone update My phone is a Galaxy Note 9,1
337,this version and the previous version sucks it was stable when the slack version still had old logo  please do a diligent job before releasing if there is onething you can do tell me how to go back to stable level  i reinstalled this 3 times and no luck crashes under a minute,1
338,Something is definitely wrong with latest updates The app is extremely show takes seconds to respond to navigation taps constantly drains my phones battery Multiple times a day out of nowhere my phone shows me a popup that says slack has stopped In general right now the app is unusable,1
339,This is a very good program for huge groups of people in a huge organization Im using it as part of an online community called Affiliate Triad Its an online marketing experiencing/train as you go program which doubles as a big mastermind group as well As a newbie all I can say it looks to be a very lucrative venture But I digress The reason Im writing this so called review is to ask the people behind this how can I download the PC version of this program on my PC I have it already on my phone and all I do here is get the msg of what devices that I have that its compatible with of my phones but nothing is mentioned about a PC version I was told you had one for PCs Is that true What must I do to get it Thanks,4
340,The app is decent but installing it made my phone (Galaxy S9) slow down a problem that resolved only after uninstalling,3
341,The app is amazing with all its capabilities Im super happy for the newer notification allowance settings though if have to set them every week It would be amazing if you could set specific weekdays like the clock on phones does for the people working set schedules to avoid having to manually snooze them every week,4
342,The development team has done an excellent job of taking a good app and gradually making it worse and worse Weird font changes app buttons overlapping Android system buttons breaking Markdown formatting while introducing a clunky formatting bar missing emoji and the occasional crash or service outage have reduced this from a fivestar app to twostar At this pace they may reach onestar level by midyear 🦾,2
343,Amazing product but Android App is not as good as iOS Android app takes a lot of time to refresh sometimes shows mixed UI  like two channels overlapping each other and sometimes if u click on a channel it takes u to the previously visited channel One of the major flaw is not having a refresh capability Everytime I have to close the app and start again Never had these problems in iOS Android App sucks,3
344,Ive been using Slack both personally (via communities Im a part of) and work for several years now and no complaints whatsoever The app especially has a lot to offer in the tech industry with reliable features including but not limited to automated webhook integration into a channel informative code/text snippets and cant forget its video call feature (which I still kinda use to this today) Highly recommended for all your work and community needs,5
345,Buggy but it will do If you close a private message in the app it will just open back up when you open the app next time Clearing the cache will make them instantly come back without leaving the app So Im stuck with a bunch of names on my list Theyre not drafts They just wont go away,1
346,Ive been using Slack for a while and its a good IM app to manage teams a few months ago I asked if there was a dark mode and they said there wasnt but they did want to make it Today I just decided to randomly open Slack settings and there was the switch for dark mode It works very well from what I can tell I do appreciate that the devs continue to work on and improve Slack,4
347,I love slack but the android app for me sometimes can be buggy Its usually after an update then within a week or so slack will push out a patch to resolve the issue and its back to normal That said slack is a fantastic service for teams to better collaborate with and beats more traditional communication like email 10 out of 10 times Love slack,4
348,Hate it It so over complicated its a joke I never get notifications on my phone I can never find past conversations on my phone It makes me hate messaging and only want to communicate via email Its literally the worst instant messaging thing Ive ever used in my life Mostly I just tried to email and text people I work with now cuz this is so terrible,1
349,I already became frustrated with the app after only using it for about 20 minutes or a half hour theres no way to delete channels from an Android phone and there is also no way to change channel settings to private from an Android phone these are all relatively simple tasks that I should be able to easily click maybe once or twice to accomplish and yet its always telling me when I look at the FAQ to go find a desktop to do this unfortunately this app only lasted about 30 minutes,2
350,I love Slack great application I give the mobile app a 3 star though because for some reason it cant handle message badges properly even though Ive read a channels message multiple times it still shows as unread Ive scrolled through clicked the 20+ unread button etc,3
351,I have shbmitted a log with notification problem No sound vibration on new messages for note 10 I tried all the troubleshooting such as adaptive powersaving exception reset cache in app settings and do not disturb etc Still does not work Please fix Other app notifications are fine,1
352,Update: the latest update seems to have resolved most of my stability issues (light status bar icons on light theme within a channel typing indicators never resolving blank screens and janky transitions) Please do not bring back the popup box for slash commands  it was a very poor experience on mobile and hijacking the navigation on keyboard input is just not going to be a good experience,2
353,Great (when it works) Picked up a problem over the last few weeks where incoming notices and messages work as usual but I cant set a status or send any messages All attempts to reset cache or reinstall the app have not fixed the problem,2
354,Ive been using Slack for several years now and all of a sudden it keeps logging me off This is very frustrating,2
355,The UX seems to take a step back with each major release The / shortcut menu on mobile makes it impossible to finish typing an action seamlessly The simple things that you expect to work wind up getting removed or updated to make it less intuitive and later patched back in eg using markup instead of their editor to compose messages,2
356,Somehow this app still lacks a dark theme despite users hackily forcing one on the desktop for a while now The new icon is bad and normally thats of little concern except someone pointed out it looks like a phallic facist logo and now I cant unsee it I think Ive seen a dozen logos suggested by the public that are magnitudes better Otherwise the app works decently though sometime doesnt exactly send messages when it should,3
357,App needs the ability to signout and not lose signin credentials Perhaps a fingerprint or pin feature to easily log back in w/out losing credentials Otherwise its a pain to have to relogin everytime you want to start mobile Please build this enhnacement feature,3
358,So many glitches Messages and images wont send on Android 10 (OnePlus 5) A few versions ago it ran perfectly and was stable back in October 2019 The most recent updates make it unusable and I still have to pull out the work laptop,1
359,Basic a free alternative its nice that its provided That being said I dont care for it I believe there are better options depending on the project I believe others in our group were too busy to catch on  learn to use the features,3
360,Useful userfriendly endless channel options inc group dms and specifics I have never experienced any technical issues connecting app issues or faulty communication paths in receiving or transmitting The work spaces I have been part of demand professionalism and high work ethics and that has always been achieved within the app capabilities and community The prices beyond the free version are reasonable especially with the amount of free messages offered Highly recommend Slack app,4
361,It works So far behind discord though Breaks a lot  loses draft if rotate missing notofications unread notifications not clearing Updates disapper features like custom daye reminders Schedule send is nice No way to categorize channels or lock one to only mod posts No admon/mod controls Discords lacks too but bot ecosystem is stellar Slack  stop sucking,3
362,Trash Just trash By default the apps notification system is set to a weird time and it syncs to the desktop app so the desktop app gets bufud When you change the desktop notifications the mobile doesnt sync so you gotta do it on the mobile app all over again However the most egregious Idiocracy is that the app doesnt have a default sound So when it notifies you it doesnt make any sound I had to go into android OS and set a sound Why Justwhy,1
363,I use Slack to communicate with my team at our hotel The channels dms and reminders are Lifesavers Slack is way more effective than email and simple sms Were able to pass information on to everyone and stay up to date on everything through the app Having a desktop version also allows me to keep it open while at my desk to continue working without having to look at my phone,5
364,Easy to use but it has to be killed and relaunched daily because it will stop syncing some features with the server The usual problems are that messages become stuck in the unread state inbound messages are missing or outbound messages arent sent,3
365,It is not possible to delete unwanted workspaces on this app or the website You can on the desktop app but it does not sync with the mobile app or website versions Meaning you will always have unwanted workspaces regardless of what the desktop app shows It is also not possible to schedule a reply I would recommend Discord over this in any circumstance as it is actually usable,2
366,Overall pretty good There are issues though For example the way that the application handles the Activity stack causes the user to have to potentially back out of multiple screens before the app will close,4
367,New update ruined the interface like I dont understand just channels on home tab so if you have 5060 channels how you would manage it do you have to search all the time Please revert your changes to old version We are more concerned with whats going on within the channel and that functionality was being fulfilled in the previous versions,2
368,App gets confused and shows you the messages from the wrong channel all the time Why does a conversation with someone disappear from the list of conversations just because there is a new message Just highlight it or display it in both the unread and the normal location Removing it from the convo list is just confusing,1
369,Doesnt have features that normal messaging apps have No read receipts and many many glitches You can send devs a screen capture of of your problem demonstrated and theyll still act like they dont understand Recently large swaths of messages will be missing from conversations and no amount of clearing the cache or restarting the app fixes it,2
370,The issue was fixed at the cost of total reversal of advanced tablet style UI the same as desktop Now everything runs in phone UI no matter what device you are using  old reciew:Doesnt display messages and chats correctly 90% of the time when I open the app,1
371,They removed the ability to format messages with markup from mobile which makes my usage way harder Im constantly block quoting and code fencing copy pasting snippets from various places Theres no reason to remove this feature from mobile Using the wysiwyg editor is absolutely miserable,1
372,I just wish notifications would work reliably And now I have to close the app sometimes to see recent messages Sometimes the app shows the indication of a message but does not show the message until the app is closed and reopened,2
373,Newest ui changes are garbage The opposite of WYSIWYG immediately after the so called WYSIWYG text editor in the desktop apps Whos driving that ui team and where are they trying to go From here it looks like theyre trying to make a social media app out of a collaboration tool features that enable ease of use be damned,1
374,Issues with cache and updating on Android Notifications popup and you cant get to the message from the notification Sometimes resetting cache works but sometimes it doesnt They said they were going to fix this a while ago and have not,2
375,I never get notifications even with the desktop app installed (PC) mobile app (Android) and all notification settings set to ON via email desktop and mobile for every single message For me no notifications makes it practically unusable,1
376,Latest update UX isnt that great It looks like its trying to copy every other messaging app Opening the side nav and having it push over the chat was much better rather than actually navigating away from the chat It moved too far away from the desktop version in terms of UX I wish I didnt update,2
377,Audio/video quality is satisfactory but screen sharing is too flaky which is disappointing because it often forces you to switch to Zoom or Webex Notification cant be customized and theres a considerable lag between messages delivered to this app and the laptop app Slack as a service is great but expected more from the app,3
378,Clever release notes are great and all but there are still core functionality issues such as syncing notifications across platforms that do not work Slack support has not been helpful they only point to the notification setting which has no effect on the syncing I am upgrading to 2 stars though since it doesnt crash anymore for me,2
379,Im sorry for giving 1 star but I am super frustrated I already spoke about the fact that no external link posted in chat or DM could be opened since the last update UNLESS you used Slacks internal browser I always had mine set to open Chrome and now not a single Twitter IG or any nonHTTP link can be opened I was contacted by a rep who assured the problem was known and would be fixed Another update appears and the problem is still occurring This bug has caused many issues Please fix,1
380,Convenient chat app nice integration a bit annoying that it doesnt archive old messages unless you pay them I wouldnt say the integrations are extremely compelling and for some you might be able to get away with just using Discord,4
381,Im missing the ability to turn off my notifications Sometimes the bell is there sometimes its not I either have to uninstall it or turn my phone off if I dont want it firing notifications all day Previous version had no issues,2
382,Notifications are super busted in v2002200 They will NEVER clear now unless you manually clear them yourself and its definitely an app bug as reverting to a December 2019 build fixed it Please fix it preferably for v20022002 for the cool version number,1
383,(Update) I noticed you added this feature Thank you so much you guys are great Please just give me the option to have it notify my mobile device ALWAYS according to my mobile settings I dont care if I have an active desktop connection somewhere,5
384,Every time since the last update when I switch pages channels look at a photo look at a contacts details it gives me a glitch where it tells me switching languages will just take a moment then kicks me out or I cant leave the channel in in or it goes to the bottom of a chat when I was looking up somewhere Super frustrating to deal with,1
385,App works great and notification issue got fixed (through an onoff type solution) Some things that would be nice to have:  the ability to react to a threaded message without having to open the thread  the ability to mark a message as read from the notification centre All in all super useful app that has made my workplace and team communication much better,4
386,Horrible keep crashing sees like a WebView Doesnt show messages properly the huddle keeps crashing the app and doesnt even think to use a normal call Unfortunately its became a quite necessary to use it since the mobile app its not practical to use it and its too bad as the slack android app,1
387,Every time when I have personal conversation with someone with desktop version it takes dats to update on mobile with mobile version I enter to that conversation and there was not any new convorsation it is really annoying it is so long I have this issue with android,1
388,while i still like the old design and app the new one seems to work pretty well wish there was a way to control size of the interface though right now everything is too big looks like a kids toy,3
389,Unable to send messages or connect to any workspace when connected to wifi However the same issue does not occur when I use mobile internet But my laptop slack does work when it is connected to same wifi Please suggest workaround resolve this for me ASAP,2
390,The app works just like the desktop app however one really annoying feature is not being able to mute groups different on desktop and mobile If I am on my slack group on my desktop I dont want my phone buzzing away everytine messages come in Also I would like to mute certain groups from mobile notifications when they are less urgent but doing so mutes it on desktop too,3
391,The mobile app is full of bugs The one I found most hilariously funny was when I couldnt found a way to leave a huddle call I had to log out I couldnt help laughing when I still found myself in the huddle Ultimately I had to uninstall the app to disconnect the huddle call,1
392,Sometimes shows Unread Notification when there are no unread messages May take few seconds for new messages to arrive only on Phone app Huddle feature across machine to phone is slightly buggy but yeah I guess it will get thereOtherwise a good app overall,3
393,superidiot notification feature i am using on wrb and mobile web always kicked out without any notification when having new message mobile can not receive and notification super useless and make me missing my attendance when work from home,1
394,When we accidentally add a person to the channel we cant remove them There should be some way to remove that person If a person doesnt accept the invite he still remains in group as invited only even after 6 months he should get auto removed Note all These missing features are identified when I used Gmail app,1
395,Constantly plagued by bugs never works properly Often have to manually clear the cache to remove deleted messages Reactions often dont work properly No wonder so many have moved to Discord,1
396,Updated my latest version I cant sign in and loading all the time without error message or else Repeating installuninstall not any changes at all How come ,5
397,Good app but the notifications need to be updated I got 8 messages read it close the app but the 8 unread message wont reset,3
398,After I contacted Slack team regarding my login issue they promptly responded to my query and helped to resolve it Changing the rating from 1 to 5 star A service like this truly deserves it,5
399,Love the app but SO ANNOYED by the notification dot that wont go away Tried shift +esc cache clear data clear reinstall Drives me nuts,2
400,Notification is not reliable Sometimes it is late Already lock in recent disable battery optimization allow startup,1
401,A while you were muted feature would be nice to keep track of messages received when you were on do not disturb mode,3
402,Notifications not working on Mi Band It stopped automatically from past 1020 days Please fix this,1
403,Average for chat terrible for getting work done Worst of all for finding stuff and for ad hoc closed conversations Otherwise great,2
404,Has lot of issues Keyboard is collapsing every time Messages are duplicating Not receiving all the messages,2
405,Mobile Slack app is NOT getting notifications on realtime when there is a new message sent by anyone The desktop app is good in this case by the way,1
406,App worked perfectly until yesterday App wont even login in for me it just keeps loading and loading without ever opening,1
407,The app is useful well organized and intuitive But for me the biggest issue is that I never receive notifications until I open the app and this is always a problem because I miss important messages So Slack for me is not trustworthy,3
408,I was facing some issues then updated to the latest version and it stopped working all together,2
409,Doesnt seem to work on Pixel 6 with video calls calls drop out and app crashes can you please resolve,1
410,Update: cannot join an invitation for a group Sometimes app doesnt even open just keep on loading ,1
411,Somehow Slack is showing as Conversations instead of Alerting notifications under the notification area in Android 11 when new messages arrive which affects alertings to wearable devices Please fix this or give option to turn off the Conversations mode Thanks,2
412,Nice app overall but awful login process Many times it cant even support all rooms,3
413,Cant close collapse or minimize Giphies in Android app and they loop forever so in slow conversations busy Giphies are extremely distracting In the Windows app Giphies can be minimized Should be trivial to fix 28 Months Later still no way to close/minimize Giphy Wow Rating dropped to 1,1
414,Would be a 5/5 but for this really annoying glitch Whenever I open the app from a notification that notification is channel related When I continue to navigate the app from that instance it continually defaults back to the original Channel no matter which channel I am trying to chat in at the time Its extremely frustrating,2
415,Great app Corporate control on your phone Allows you to control your worker bees Your boss will always know what you are up to with the handy dandy slack statuses App icon is so trendy too Looks like Google designed it creativity I sometimes open this amazing app instead of Google Photos Very similar colors great app recommend for corporate goodness,5
416,I have problem downloading Slack on my Mac i get server with specific hotsname could not be found Also when opening it I get a white screen,1
417,Its a great app but sometimes it just stops and I cant scroll or type Cleaning the cache can help but this behavior is not exactly appealing If you put that aside it works well for multiple accounts and many channels The synchrony between the app and desktop is also good,3
418,Android app is unbearable plenty of times I made sure that I have all the notification settings turned on and not a single notification appears This is a very serious bug considering that this is a app that most people uses for work and not for fun,1
419,Mostly decent But quite hard to see all the messages you havent read yet you have to open up categories and click each one to see if theres something in there Needs a way of seeing all unread messages like desktop,3
420,Mobile experience is absolutely terrible and almost unusable now Earlier opening thread and going back used to go to main screen so cant view threads in channel Now Language change popup keeps popping up Clearing cache doesnt work,1
421,Used to work perfectly but with the latest android system update I get kicked out of all my call after 30 seconds to 2 minutes after joining the call Really disappointed,2
422,Unable to open my app on my Galaxy 20S  The app sends am email to my inbox and once I click to verify email address  I receive a msg from the app that something went wrong at other times it just crashes I uninstalled and reinstalled 3 times I restarted my phone  still nothing Quite frustrating,1
423,Unreliable notifications sometimes but what is worse is clicking on say the 3rd image of a list and get always the first one no matter I am sorry to say this but this is truly one of those apps that feel they get worse with every update :(,1
424,The slack desktop is way good But the mobile app is worst for the notifications part I receive notifications after 15 mins of the originally received messages And its so annoying that I get notifications for hundreds of messages at once so that I have to force stop the app in my android mobile,2
425,Often getting a pop notification which says changing language,3
426,Till the last update it was perfectly fine But with this build Im not getting my notifications I get messages when I open the app All notifications are allowed but app mutes them Tried disabling battery optimization as well but no luck Please fix it ASAP,2
427,I always have trouble to load my Slack messages in the phone It takes a long time to bring in the messages and it really makes it impossible for me to respond while am AFK All other apps are completely fine Just find trouble here Any advise is most welcome,1
428,Its cool and all but aint this just a business version of Discord Like doesnt it look eerily similar to Discord🤔🤨,3
429,I wish the UI was also optimized for tablet users Would be nice to switch to a desktoplike interface in landscape mode  very useful for those who use Samsung DeX or those who use their tablets as a laptop replacement,4
430,This app needs serious improvement I cant remove inactive members from a channel I created So disgusting seeing that this is the app recommended by my Boss I hate it and please dont as me to send a mail to your feedback team because I wont do that,1
431,Great app Runs smoothly and has all the desktop features My original issue of buggy photo uploads has been addressed One big detractor is the Camera feature It has no stabilization and photos always come out blurry,4
432,Refuses to log in Stupid method to log in via a confirmation email instead of password Slack used to be great now both desktop and phone apps are just unresponsive annoying and ineffective,1
433,Hangs when there are a lot of photos in gallery to choose,3
434,Not able to sign in Its so wrong that in times of need this app is acting so badly,1
435,Dont know much about Slack (had to download for a course Im registered in) Trying to upload a profile picture but every attempt has been unsuccessful Select pic press done nothing happens annoyance/frustration ,1
436,The app isnt working at all on my android It used to work pretty well now I cant do anything with the app,1
437,Hey Slack devs Can you make the zoom in/out functionality to be faster Also can you introduce a way for my direct messages to be ordered by who the last sent/received message was from  the same way as in the desktop application instead of by alphabetical order please,3
438,Finally managed to stop Slack closing every time it was minimised and then the widgets disappeared I had direct DM widgets set up and they just vanished as did the option to create more In fact there are no slack widgets showing at all,1
439,The app seems to get stuck in a loop not letting me get to the home screen when opining via a reply notification I have to restart every time this happens,2
440,Essential tool for work and easy to use,5
441,Slack is good but mobile app is not robust Toggling between chats is mis functioning If you come back from threads it will directly come out from whole group and then it will marked as whole group as marked You will loose unead messeges Strongly disagree to read threads in mobile app,2
442,Not able to install Slack on my device I have tried all possible troubleshooting methods to resolve this issue Every time getting the same massage,1
443,Great app Can do everything you can do on the web,5
444,Unable to login with google account as the app keeps crashing,1
445,Why huddle (voice talk) requires Bluetooth access Or access to bluetooth devices Huh Even though Bluetooth is offline and i just want normal speaker etc,2
446,Unable to get to my channels anymore,1
447,Horrible to use on my mobile keeps closing when answering a call,1
448,I hope there is also an option for share screen on tablets I just joined a short training session that required a share screen and I couldnt Thats just disappointing,3
449,Takes a while to learn its tricks but great when you know them,4
450,After geting magic code in my email when click on confirm button it says something went wrong Unable to use on android mobile But working on my macbook air,1
451,Many times dont get notifications Test notification works but actual notifications not received many times,3
452,Its just a shameless copy of discord and Microsoft teams The worst part is that making an account or joining a work group is confusing for no reason Its also really poorly optimized for Android and is really slow and buggy,1
453,Password recovery sucks and app logs you out randomly,1
454,Please help I was invited to a workspace via my email on desktop I am currently using that workspace on desktop but when I try to sign in with the same Email from Mobile App it says me to Enter the password which I forgot when I am trying to reset the password it sends an email that my account has not been created Please help,1
455,Its percent easy to use guaranteed and clear to use the app Love it Thank you for making it convenient for us,5
456,Whenever I try to sign in with my email ID it always shows SOMETHING WENT WRONG PLEASE TRY AGAIN LATER,1
457,Joining calls on a mobile (huddle) disconnect randomly after a few seconds to a couple of mins,1
458,A few updates after you cant zoom in attached images normally Why do you hate your users so much It used to work ok back in a day,3

499,Cannot copy messages to clipboard ,1
500,Notification seems to be a problem,3
501,Very intuitive and easy to use,5
502,App is forced closed whenever I join a call or a meeting,1
503,Unfortunately the app is terrible Nothing works in offline mode at all it is impossible even to view the message history in offline For what this application exist The application is very slow Takes too much memory There is no point in this application since you can use the web version through a browser,1
504,I dont receive sound notifications in my poco x3 nfc,1
505,Should be great but cant join ongoing calls on Pixel 6,3
506,Great design and quality,5
507,Customization on notifications from specific group dm and channels is terribly limited  either block nothing everything or everything but Editing a message takes a million button clicks and is so difficult on the desktop version as well (click the 3 dots on the side of the message really Its a desktop app right click is a thing) This app is a great example of how web 30 ruin a good thing The engine and backend of slack is solid but the UI design looks over functionality,2
508,Does not sync correctly for 1 pro workspace The not pro workspace works correctly,1
509,The app doesnt stay in the background task Everytime I have to open the app,1
510,Rarely works as it should,2
511,Great design easy to use,5
512,Please add voice note feature in this it would bring huge convince,3
513,Please consider apart from pinning down important messages within a chat to star or mark somehow messages u wish to see later Cause when u receive bulk it is easy to lose an information or forget to get back to someone Other than that it is super fun And the ability to create your own emojibrilliant,4
514,Doesnt work on WiFi (works on mobile network and desktop version works on WiFi) Downloading images doesnt show any progress or notification when its complete and usually it just fails without any notification,2

516,Fully dropped and blocked all androids before 80 so you need to buy new phone in order to use it,1
517,a lot of bugs including serious ones,3
518,Cant log in from email today,1
519,I can speak international languages anyone in the world can get in touch with myself Id be glad to help and advise READ MY BOOKS WITH SPOTIFY Xx x Hopes Adventures and Marinas Quest Working on Freedom With Rex a self helpbook lets follow your dreams Next book is called Heavens Gate Open xxx,5
520,Copy paste is not working for links post last update Please send fix urgently,1
521,Slow full of bugs,2
522,The design makes no sense The whole idea of a 100 different channels for the same group is dumb Theres a reason why all other chat apps are designed differently And the fact that the notification system is so complicated that you can only get notified of someone tags the channel I have no words dumbest UI ever created No idea how it could become so popular,1
523,New update with the pop up is so annoying,1
524,Hanging all the times and calls not connecting,1
525,Extremely messy enormously bulky and ridiculously primitive app This app is something which is not supposed to exist at all Its super unreliable bloated and slow You never get your messages in real time the layout is incredibly confusing and on top of that it takes 900 MB from my phones storage This is unbelievable This is more than all my other apps out together Not to mention that there is no Mark as read option in the pull down menu The developers seem to be a bunch of idiots,1
526,Till the new update everything was perfectly fine From the time I updated my slack there are many bugs I am facing Whenever I click on threads of a message it shows ‘Sorry an error occurred Please try again later’ although I have a good internet connection Please look into this and fix it ASAP I will rate this app 5 stars Edit: Problem fixed Thanks,1
527,No option to leave a workspace in the app which is really not convinient,1
528,App not working on phone  very probelmetic while sharing docs from another app,1
529,I couldnt send any messages on my phone app and I tried to use the troubleshoot notification function to resync everything but found that it wouldnt run So I uninstalled and reinstalled the app and it got worse I cant even sign in to the app now It just gives me a message of something has gone wrong Please try again I tried uninstalling and reinstalling again and its still the same Please fix this your app is broken,1
530,The App is fine  no complaints there But I feel I must comment on some of your replies to the 1 star reviews :) I can hardly see someone who had given you a 1 star rating with a pretty clear reason why they did so being motivated to go to your feedback page only to type in the same thing again Your response doesnt come across to me as being very acknowledging Have a think about it,4
531,Team members can no longer use the app because it is not compatible with the version of Android that their phone has which cant be upgraded further So many complications and issues using this Cant even easily skip straight to the most recent messages despite pointing this issue out to them weeks ago Best you can get is the first message of the day Which could be hundreds of messages ago,1
532,Good but a lot of the time I dont get any notifications,3
533,We need a Slack widget to show most recent mentions or a list of channels that got updates,3
534,Relatively good app but I cannot stand the late notifications It irks me so much Why do I start getting notifications for conversations that already ended hours back Sometimes it makes me think I have a new message only to open up and see it was from a conversation I had prior and already finished Fix it please,3
535,Hi Team something is wrong after the update I am facing difficulty in viewing and sending the msg Many times it is showing fail to connect even if i jave network I am getting notification of the msg but chat is not happening realtime,1
536,The app is good but a few comments 1 When internet is not so great you gtw to a situation when you get a notification open the app and you cant see the message you just received via notification 2 Can you please add the option to read the message via notification bar like Gmail/whatsapp 3 Can you please add the option to control the vibration pattern Thanks,3
537,I was thrilled when Slack finally allowed for Scheduled Messages on mobile However its buggy  sometimes it works in successfully scheduling a message and other times longpressing the Send button to schedule a message will send the app crashing Killing and restarting the app doesnt solve this problem Its unpredictable when Id be able to schedule a message or not and the problem sometimes goes away on its own ps please dont ask me to submit an email for feedback,1
538,Crashes when trying to select and send a picture The app is getting worse and worse Then I realized the phones picture view app also crashed by or no responding by then Not sure if that was due to slack though Its just that it happened while I tried to use slack to select a picgure then slack became nonresponsible and also made the phones other app cannot read pictures Everything works again after I restart my phone But it seemed happended to me a few times before as well that when using slack to send phone pictures it wasnt so smooth experience on my phone But other chat app such as WeChat never had any problems so it could be slack related,1
539,Why is Sign out not easy to do Please dont have it hidden somewhere,1
540,UI is confusing especially to my less techsavy coworkers I often cant see new messages or cant load messages from earlier that day Notifications are hard to manage and regularly glitch so that I get a notification for new messages but there are none and the notification never clears Really useful for work but I wish it was more useable and reliable,2
541,I have started using from last 2 month Initially it worked decent But from last 15 days app not working properly Sometimes not getting notification Also message not getting sent Always showing trying to connect slack error message Sometimes sign also not working Need to try signup atleast 45 time with 23 time app uninstall Thats very irritating when we have something on priority Please look into it,1
542,Generally a good app but frequently when you share some file it gets stuck so you can only really retry sending it and theres no option to actually cancel sending,3
543,Desktop Slack client is great but mobile client is just weird copy of it that does not work ideally App spawns most likely tons of screens as i can go back almost indefinitely shows that i have unread messages even though i read them all several times refreshing/relying on the app to get realtime data is not the best decision and plenty of more,2
544,On mobile version all the uploaded images are signed as error and listed at the end of a conversation When there are multiple of them I have to scroll up until I see recent message Tapping accidentally on the errored img (send on the desktop app btw where everything works good) resends the img again Its really prevents me from using mobile app which is a pity I wish I could manipulate the volume of notification sound on the desktop version,1
545,Very good app one problem the messages stay on your bar as having a new an unread message even if you have already read the message it will only disappear from the notification bar if you enter the app to read the message via clicking on the notification bar (not if you have clicked to open the app the regular way and read your messages),4
546,Awesome tool for working on projects worth teams Thanks for making this amazing tool,5
547,Good app but the latest update (Slack 210910 September 7 2021) really has alot of lag when the app is first starting up Much more noticable lag then when compared to the previous version of Slack I had installed (Slack 210810 August 9 2021) And yes my Android phone is current running 80 or above version of andriod Is Slack available to (safely) sideload older versions of the app perhaps on FDroid or somewhere else,3
548,Not allowing weblogin from tablet Redirecting to download app and from app no option showing to login to multiple workspaces Add another workspace says there is a glitch,1
549,Updated to the last version and got new app design What a fail this is really bad Awkward interface So laggy last few days app doesnt even work Desktop design is perfect thats why you became the most popular platform for teams DO NOT ruine it with your mobile app Give us option to use old interface,1
550,Avatars of people are mimatched with one another Unable to read messages Notifications are pushed after I already read the messages I have a ticket open with Slack support  sent videos and logs showing all the issues Support basically telling me its a known issue The issues are more than 6 mounth old I think Its almost unusuable at this stage,1
551,I was successfully using this app on my android phone up until this morning when it suddenly decided it no longer wanted to show me new messages I uninstalled/reinstalled and now it wont even let me sign in I use this daily for work and now I cant access it unless Im on my laptop Very poor experience,1
552,I use this for coordinating DD games I run It is a brilliant low impact app that allows for conversations with groups of players or individuals Allows for session planning in common rooms Witcher meme postings polls as to who ate the most pizza last game and allows me to flex my DM skills by sending private messages of doom and wonder Ahem I mean it is nice getting one on one alerts with people,5
553,I have been invited with different emails to different channels On the phone app cannot find how to log out and log in with different profiles nor how to use both together It is really not intuitive On desktop version it works,2
554,There is a problem with your desktop app It wont connect to the internet and even when I try to go on your website I get This site cant be reached while all other websites are working on all my other tabs Can you please repair this as quickly as possible Slack has become very important to get through a work day,1
555,This has been pretty bad in the past but has become unusable in the past few weeks In the past I would see a channel had new messages but when I clicked on it I would only see the old messages Now when I open the app it doesnt even highlight the channels with new messages When I open the desktop app I see that many channels have unread messages that didnt show up on the mobile app,1
556,I raised one issue of not able to login neither with workspace nor with the email address no need to address it Slack was blocked by my network Resolved already another issue is still there that other people might have also raised ie logging out automatically for no reason Not a big issue but sometimes it bugs out Please look into it,1
557,Theres a very curious bug: when Im typing a message in my work account then take a camera picture from within the app to attach it to the message and then continue typing the app kicks me out of my account and I have to log back in,1
558,I am not able to sign in to slack as soon as i enter my email i get an error message stating Something went wrong please try again and if i enter workspace url error message is something like Sorry an error occured Please try again Please help me resolve this issue asap,1
559,Slack is great but the app needs work Notifications are intermittent at best Sometimes new messages dont even appear,3
560,Opening an image from a middle of a thread then closing it scrolls you all the way down to the thread,1
561,Personally laptop is fine Im using phone and I keep typing email multiple times to send the link for the workspace but doesnt work (no email received)  I pressed the original shared link multiple times but it does not register me in Not sure what I can do next Q exasperated actl,2
562,Cant even log in with Google When I try to select the Google account it takes me to settings instead of using that account And if I try to send a magic link it takes me to the same log in with Google screen Whats the point of a magic link then I am logged in to the Google account in my phone already,1
563,Good app but there are few bugs 1) I dont receive few messages notifications 2) I click in a group with unread messages check all of them and the app keeps showing them as unread 3) I cant use workflow shortcuts,3
564,Great app great support Had a bug in Slack and the great support team tried to help me like no other support team I contact in my life You are a role model,5
565,Login issue here although I may attribute the issue from Google itself not showing my work email on their web app auth page My work email is present when viewed from phone settings but the Slack Confirm Email is redirecting me to the web app which is broken So Im going full circle here and I cannot login my Googleprovided identity Slack account on mobile,1
566,The app notifications is broken in few updates back I set to only notify in mobile devices when I am inactive in desktop but the mobile apps (both iOS and Android) keeps showing the notifications even if I am online in desktop this is really annoying please fix it,2
567,I like being able to respond to work messages when Im out or away from the desk but whats really annoying is that the messages arrive way late than the time they were sent on This is really making the app unusable please fix this Thanks in advance,3
568,New update having channels in home page is great,5
569,Desktop Slack is brilliant Truly fantastic Phone app is a bit slow A bit lacking Dont get me wrong I can get done what I need to get done eventually It just takes quite a bit longer than youd want What would take a second or two over the desktop takes 30 or even 60 seconds over the app,4
570,I dont get notification the instant the message is sent by someone in slack It doesnt send notifications I have to constantly check my phone app to see if there are any updates please fix this bug I have tried all fixes from setting,1
571,I like the new update where you can send an audio and do video call However it seems that everytime I try to send a music it doesnt plays like when you click the music it just routes you to download the music Please fix thank you,3

575,Bug Slack app keeps signing me out every time Pretty annoying I need to login again whenever I need to use the app The logging process is also bad every time I need to use the magic link,1
576,Lack of free version voice notes makes it a bit annoying but good app Also needs more notification settings,3
577,Im going to rate this a onestar because reinstalling is proving more difficult than using the troubleshooting option in the app This is over two hours of reinstalling and Im still unable to communicate with colleagues,1
578,Perfect for meeting corporate communication,5
579,Cant sign back in due to an unexpected error,1
580,Good There is a bug: The typing indicator bugs sometimes and shows there is a person writing but thats not true and i have to close and open the app again see if he is actually writing or not Edit: Still not fixed even after 7 months,3

783,Glitchy never clears read messages,1
784,Work very well for both phone and tablet,5
785,In next update Give an option whether the message is seen or not,1
786,What happened I have to have this app for work but today it quit working and wants me to download a new app picture this and sign up all over again,1
787,Literally forced to download this app Just wanted to open in browser,1
788,This app is horrendous for large groups Basically my prof wanted slack as a disucssion platform for classes However creating a new channel (for a new discussion) requires MANUALLY ADDING EACH PERSON If youre talking about a size of 300 people have fun mate Copying a list of email solves the hassle but creates a new issue of requiring additional confirmation from invited usersDuplicate accounts were also appearing Its frankly ridiculous there isnt just an ADD ALL option,1
789,I will be able to do it always is golden Dollar general manager at American express discover card,5
790,Good and easy for office communications,4
791,I only see one message when I open the app  Slack isnt responding,1

795,Never worked on my phone,1
796,I cant update my profile photo besides that  youll be fine,3
797,No video and no screen sharing during video calls,1
798,Very cool way to communicate,5
799,Notification issues are there often,3
800,slack notifications are the most unreliable Ive ever experienced in any app Even with app optimization off Logged a troubleshooting request with support and they responded that they knew notifications were broken and theres no fix,1
801,Simply doesnt work,1
802,stopped working on my tablet no upgrade available,1
803,I would give 5 because when it was working it was working without any major issues and was fairly well designed application But cutting out hard on users with older (and working perfectly fine otherwise) versions of Android and forcing them to buy a new device as an upgrade option was a very arrogant move Id award Slack app with no points for that if I could,3
804,Great app I love it,5
805,Was working fine this morning then tried to use this afternoon and apparently my OS is no longer supported and I cant access the app at all not even to see previous messages Super frustrating I have a Samsung Galaxy S6 Not a new phone by any means but still works perfectly The about this message suggested it could still be used but might not be perfect It will not work AT ALL Grrr,1
806,I am trying to connect to my existing account from mobile and 1 It doesnt give me the option to sign in a google account and 2 When i put my email to that specifc adress it doesnt send the confirmation email I tried other addresses and it worked what to do ,2
807,Brilliant for networking,5
808,Nice app a bit too techie for me,4
809,The fact that Android 7 is not supported is ridiculous What should I do using Samsung A5 2016 for which it is the latest Android version It works fine when I open the app via pushnotification But when I switch organizations or try to open the app from scratch it suddenly gets unsupported Whats wrong with keeping it running for Android 7,1
810,I have had no issue with slack over the past 25 years of usage But with the new upgrade I cant use slack on my mobile any longer The error is This app is not available for your device I am not in a position to change phones now Since I use slack for work is it possible that an older version can be installed on my phone so that I can keep using slack on my mobile ,1
811,have to use for work Keeps giving problems far too often :((((,3
812,It was all good until today Im now getting a notification saying that the Android version on my phone is no longer supported and doesnt allow me to use the app at all This is completely unacceptable Should everybody now with an older version of Android (and unfortunately updates are no longer released by the manufacturer) change the phone itself to use Slack Every other app works fine on my phone why not Slack,1
813,Cant use any more because my version of android (70) is no longer supported This is ridiculous As everyone knows android device manufacturers dont release updates after a phone has been out for a few years What do slack expect users to do buy a brand new phone just to use their app Preposterous Well just switch the company over to one of their competitors like WhatsApp,1
814,Does not work properly,1
815,Many a times notifications not come from messages,1
816,Samsung active 2 having trouble connecting to see notifications on the go How do yiu add slack app to Samsung active 2,1
817,The data gets auto deleted in 15 days How will a new user come to know that it happens There wasnt any prompt/warning on the same Its highly unproductive app and I wouldnt recommend it,1
818,1) You dropped support of the old Android versions (yes security and blablabla but that is a little execuse for ones who dont want to change their phone) 2) You dont have hands free mode 3) When youre sharing screen from PC and at the same time using application for conversation and someone tries to highlight something on the shared screen using pen application crashes UPDATE Thanks for reply and clarification but what about hands free mode It is really nuts UPDATE 2 Thank you Looking forward for this feature and will change number of stars respectively :),2
819,The chat bubbles when persistent add a layer of transparency on the phone display making the other apps grey out a bit Also I cant open threads inside the chat bubble view,3
820,I use slack every day and the failure to make a conversation as read when Ive read it annoys me at least every other day Ive contacted support multiple times and theyve sorted it for me each time or by loading on a computer but that is NOT a solution Im currently on holiday with no access to a laptop and its the worst time for me to have no idea which of the messages from my team Ive already looked at,1
821,This app dont care about customer no longer supported old version of os Im moving to discord,1
822,The best apps for group work Recomended,5
823,Please store timezone with do not disturb config,5
824,I am facing this issue for morning Despite updating the app it still says that  this version of the slack app is no longer supported Update to the latest version so you can get back to slack  The current version of the slack app on my phone is 2108200 and the android version on the phone is Android 11  the device is motorola edge + I am currently unable to login into mu workplace and its very crucial please advise,1
825,The app version has many issues I always have problem to receive messages at the same time the desktop version I try to configure audio notifications in my phone but I just cant because the screen just dont show anything Its a shame because I think slack helps a lot to organise my work,2
826,Unbelievable I just tried installing Slack and couldnt understand why it didnt appear on the app store There are a lot of people with old smartphones who just dont want to buy new ones because the old ones are still good Well if there is one good thing out of this now employers wont be able to disturb so easily their employees,1
827,Cant log into a work space,4
828,Works well most of the time but recently was found to occupy over 70GB of storage on my phone for no apparent reason,4
829,Used since last full charge: 0 (4h background) Battery usage since last changed: 30% Ive never seen any app consume more battery than screen + OS except this one even without opening the app This is a unoptimized garbage app at best malware at worst as a behavior Asked my manager to exempt me from having it on the phone for work Phone becomes unusable,1
830,For me its messenger on cellphone I dont like that it call each time even if I use PC version left this message in 2016 Cant add second workspace asking email but not workspace with sso Absolute annoying double notifications Im chatting web an slack Android app beeping each freaking message Upd: Doesnt work anymore,1
831,Request to please make it enable for Chromebook,4
832,Needs to Be Erased Extremely difficult app to use ever,1
833,A lot of limitations unless you pay concept There are other platforms out there that offer more at little to no cost This is a fairly easy app to use Would have liked to see more of a cross application/platform interface,3
834,Really really really bad idea of dropping Android 7 Slack is a productivity app not just a random app with a few hundred users You guys HAVE TO do everything in order to keep support to older version of Android and we are talking about 70 not Android 44  Unbelievable So yes I wont be able to use my messaging app in the company I worked for because of this Hope you guys lost a lot of market because of these brainless ideas,1
835,quite good app but if see it from notification purpose it totally sucks  0 out of 100  except notification problem all things good,3
836,What is wrong with slack today Unable to send and receive messages so i uninstalled and reinstalled it now i am unable to sign in,1
837,I dont understand why people use this app Sloppy,1
838,I know 27 billion of dollars is a huge bunch of money but Im so sorry for dependents Slack now Long live and prosper Please make Ukrainian language interface,1
839,Great app but I dont receive message notifications,4
840,Its the most reliable and easy to use app in the category You sign up with Google account and you are ready to go Its free,5
841,amazing i love how they integrated the figma live preview it was fantastic,5
842,I am not even able to install this app and i am damn sure that my device supports it as I used to have the app on a lower end device than this one I have tried all trouble shooting steps and nothing has worked,1
843,Easiest way for people to communicate in my organization,5
844,Ive been using this app for 3 years for school purposes Still now its hard to understand Sometimes the app literally wont open Please fix the app and make it beginners friendly I appreciate your work by the way,3
845,We get offline when call comes,3
846,Was good until stopped supporting older Android its pretty unhappy decision They should have rater discontinue calls / huddle but keep messaging This way theyve effectively just cut their paying users not a professional move,2
847,Awesome app better than discord because discord is very distracting and here on Slack its a lot more professional like its supposed to be And I love how much we can customize everything and the notification settings is fire,5
848,I seem to not be able to download the slack app from play store for sone reason,1
849,The best app for communication,5
850,Its not working on my phone because apparently my os aint supported anymore Its just sad because I need it for my job and I cant afford to buy a new phone yet And its always lagging on my pc I always have to clear cache and restart,2
851,Brilliant But they make it so hard to log in or when u have any issues with ur password,4
852,I cannot login After entering the password and the confirmation sms code Im redirected to to login screen This is happening in the last few days On the desktop app I have no issues,1
853,Unable to install the app,1
854,Notifications are displayed milion years after received on PC Sometimes new messages are not loaded at all You have to do some black magic make it work again,1
855,3 stars because the app isnt giving notification on the mobile device Ive tried toggling all the possible notification settings but still no luck Please fix this ASAP without the notification Im not sure if I can even call it an IM,3
856,notification is not coming,1
857,After working perfectly for many years they pulled support for android 7 Without warning and for no discernible reason other than they do not want to keep supporting old versions,4
858,Not working properly,1
859,Its automatically crashed from my phone and after that when I am trying to install again its just giving me error dont know why I have reported the issue many times but no response,1
860,Its okay The app definitely requires a strong steady network connection otherwise youre bound to see a dreaded Connecting message permanently It seems very picky about the stability of its connection which is kind of a bummer for teams deployed on the field trying to get i touch with the office Its image upload is very lacking in that aspect It will upload pictures in full resolution which arguably is a good thing for graphic designers but a terrible thing when trying to show a quick snap of something The photo sharing feature of any other messaging app (which resizes and compress the image) is far more suited Its just impossible to upload full resolution pictures on flaky connections,3
861,Till last update it works fine aftet that seeing blank screen on direct msgs and not responding Worst,3
862,Our team uses this app daily Its ok but the problem is I dont get any notification for ongoing conversations and personal messages on my phone This is frustrating and I just have to go into the app and check again n again and if I happen to forget checking it then the team members dont get a reply on time from me which annoys me To correct this issue I have uninstalled  installed it on my mobile quite a few times but the same problem continues till now,3
863,This app is just top notch Always does what I need or what WE need Max productivity when using this I always prefer it over any others of its kind hands down And trust me I am quite picky so that is saying a lot coming from me I want to add that 99% of the people I know from work or other companies are always in agreement with this opinion So rare that an app nails it this good So thanks for that I dont get to say it enough so I make sure to do it when possible,5
864,Working too good,2
865,Fails to give message notifications 95% of the time due to which I miss very very important updates and messages UI is unresponsive and feels clunky Please improve it,2
866,Today Slack suddenly stopped working telling me that I need to buy a newer phone to keep using it I do get notifications that I have new unread messages but I can no longer see them With no warning or anything just suddenly out of nowhere,1
867,Love the idea but having trouble with the adoption Im a heavy android mobile based user and a frustrating factor for me is that Im unable to receive any form of notification from any channels Went through the suggested steps in the Help Center but there wasnt any change Not sure if its faced by others but itll be great if there could be some way to resolve this,3
868,There is a problem with notifications,3
869,Buggy app notifications and even call is disconnected still showing we are connected like,1
870,Not at all dependable from what I can tell,2
871,I truly love Slack but this week Ive been cut off saying its no longer supported by my phones OS Rather than simply preventing it from loading/working cant we just still use it albeit with possibly reduced untested features I cant afford hundreds of dollars for a new phone just to run Slack which I only use for work Now I cannot communicate with my team This is a very poor user experience I understand you cant support everything forever but the app is still giving me notifications so its still working on there to some capacity I just cant get the chat screens or interact at all Not everyone can afford a new phone every 2 years,1
872,Good app but UX on android is a bit awkward for me at least the app remembers the last channel you were in when it opens So the way my brain works I expect the back button to take me back to the home/channel selection drawer Instead it exits the app which i find really frustrating Makes me believe this has been adapted from iOS behaviour,3
873,The most unreliable login methods I have yet seen on an app in fact I cannot sign in at all on a smartphone due to the endless loop of login requirements and redirections,1
874,Absolutely love the app except for one fatal flaw: I never get any notifications Ever Even after reinstalling 5+ times logging in and out countless times etc It works like a charm on desktop but since most communication is mobile these days Ive had to resort to having people ping me on FB Messenger or WhatsApp whenever theres something important being said on Slack I want to give you guys five stars but until this gets resolved I cant,4
875,Great app overall but the new update Im sorry but this is absolutely hideous No need to fix something that aint broken Also bring back the timed channel muting options Just roll out the old version as this is horrid If I didnt have to use it for work would have deleted it straight away as Im appaled every time I open the app Not intuitive at all is ugly and uncomfortable,2
876,Very bad Magiclink by email never works,1
877,it been very helpful and engaging,5
878,Hi Slack Team Your app is nice and works great but the only problem with this app is many of user are facing issue as it has been stopped for older version phone with the lastest update It would be great if that features can be enabled in next update Thanks  Regards Slack user,3
879,Amazing app Perfectly fast and amazing for business But dont get it if you hate big business extortion,5
880,Very helpful in all aspects,5
881,They disabled support for Android vesions below 80 If you just count 71 70 and 60 thats still 10% of Android users that can no longer use this app from one day to the next What are we supposed to do Toss out our otherwise perfectly working phones and contribute to the global ewaste problem just so we can keep using Slack Same with their browser support Is your browser a bit out of date Sorry our website no longer works Why No reason we just dont like that number next to version in your browser And no Slack Ill say it before your bot bothers to respond: offering me a link to the minimum requirements in no way shape or form addresses anything I wrote,1
882,Need a short cut tab,3
883,In desktop view the letters at the very bottom are sometimes not shown fully Although its very minimal its still a little unsettling Also when they react on a message a notification on the tab would appear that looks like red and white as opposed to the all red for messages However I do not see where they reacted If we have colleagues that arent very chatty they can just use the reactions Would be helpful if you fix this I have trouble loading the site and getting in as well,3
884,Your recent update took away the LUNCH status icon,4
885,Last update made the app slow and sluggish,2
886,Is very easy to stay in contact with everyone I need to stay in contact with on this app love it,5
887,When we try to cutomize notifications for specific channels the buttons there does not behave properly As they are buttons only one of them should get selected but here mutiple get seleted And also that preference is not saved When we again open that setting all options are unselected I want to turn on notifications for some specific channels and I cant do that in app because of the problem stated above because of that I can not participate actively on discussions Please fix this,1
888,Two of the most common problems I face with the app: 1 I write something and send it gets posted twice And this is not uncommon Ive seen many people facing this issue for quite sometime now and this hasnt been fixed yet 2 I use a Redmi Note 5 Pro phone and the app keeps freezing a lot of times Ive had to close the app and reopen to fix it I havent faced this issue with other apps so Im not sure if its a phone problem or particularly an issue with slack,2
889,Delayed notifications on Android 9 Mi A1,1
890,Until recently this app has worked very well on my phone However now it is not letting me switch between my workspaces as it used to Instead when I try to switch between them by clicking on the workspace icons it demands I sign out of the space I want to enter Ive tried restarting my phone Ive tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app Ive cleared my phones cache Please fix this issue pronto The app used to work so seamlessly This new problem is very disappointing,2
891,It gets the job done but its interface is not so friendly You kinda need training before using the app For me it was easy for my colleagues it was messy and they always miss any updates I add There can be an easier way to find messages around and channels Plusthere should be away for the group owner/admin to force notifications for colleagues when needed I dunno just suggesting Thanks anyway :),3
892,Nice app for communicationbut in this generation u still havent add feature of last seenif possible please add last seen feature that would help a lot,4
893,Im getting my messages delayed quite oftensometimes the previous messages dont show up but the latest messages show up After I close the application and reopen Ill get the messages properly Sometimes I do cache clear to fix  but its annoying to do often Also when I check a new message the notification wont clear indicating that its read I use Slack both on phone and laptop At first I thought this might be due to network issues but its not the case,2
894,Every time I tap on a notification I see the changing your language would just take a moment Its so irritating and even frustrating at times I dont want to change my language I have also seen the language settings I have even tried changing the language and changing it back for all of my teams It still doesnt go Please do something about it Edit: no response and the issue isnt fixed either This has been there for quite some months actually Please fix it Its very irritating,1
895,From today morning Unable to send and receive message from both mobile and desktop app I log out from mobile app but now unable to sign in Desktop app is also not working,1
896,The WYSIWYG message field is not well implemented and relies on user input patterns that dont exist on a touch device For example an inline code block is inescapable if it is at the end of the message That alone is enough to make this app useless There is also no way to disable or remove the fancy message field editor The message field is not a word document so dont treat it as it was one When typing becomes a chore communicaton apps becomes useless Edit: There is no such option,2
897,Not supporting Android 7 all of a sudden Need to find a new messaging app now as the perfectly good phone with no issues is not going to be replaced,2
898,Nice app Great for communication because it can support a group composing of more than 200 people Its a nice app but it has some problems that I always encounter with 1st Even tho my connection is great it cant send messages fast Last the notifications also it doesnt appear sometimes even if I turned all notifications for it I hope you fix this problems soon Thank you ^^,4
899,Id say Ive had a great and seamless experience with the app 9/10 times However sometimes the app notifies me about a new message I may have got about 30 minutes late Sometimes even after I set my availability to Online it doesnt reflect that and Ive had others complain to me about why I was away for 2 hours (because I didnt realise I was still being shown away) Like I said Ive mostly had a great experience but maybe iron out a few bugs and youd deserve a 6 star rating :),3
900,Whats the problem with Android 7 No problems just a bureaucratic deprecation schedule  Okay maybe the next apk version will not support android api 24 but whats the point to lock out android 7 users from using web app ,1
901,Good experience Would be nice to have Mark as read in the notification panel instead of me having to open the app or switch between multiple workspaces And the new interface isnt visible on all workspaces Its weird to have two different interfaces at the same time Update: Thanks for replying I went into each of my workspaces closed app and opened again Now its working fine But that certainly should have happened automatically Have updated the rating,3
902,The app itself is great but this might be the worst notifications on an android messenging app Ive ever seen The notifications dont stack by channel dont have any noticeable difference between normal messages and ones with any kind of theres always only one notification on the notification bar regardless of how many unread messages from one or more channels I could go on forever nowadays its just unacceptable to have something like this on the market,1
903,It works often and other times the notifications are a total pain and either dont appear or appear a day later Today I saw 7 notifications on my laptop that didnt appear in my phone from yesterday This happens randomly and seems to be the same for many people and is a fundamental failure of a messaging app There seems to be a similar issue with calls which sometimes wont work Apart from that the app is OK but doesnt really flow It doesnt show additional workspaces Not sure if this is just my app or that I need to manually configure additional signins but would have thought that it would mirror my laptop There are probably a lot of improvements that could be made but the basics really need to be sorted out,2
904,For the last couple of days it stops working properly  I cant see the list of my channels or contacts  its all blank However if I click on the empty line the channel or conversation opens and I can see the messages but its like walking blind in the dark forest  you never know which tree you hit or how to find the one you need And its so frustrating as theres a lot happening at my workspace at the moment and I have to struggle with such a trivial thing like app fail,2
905,It is one of the worst Android apps that I have used On laptop it works flawlessly On mobile it just shows notifications on clicking the notification it takes forever to load and doesnt even display the full message many times Even if you reply to a text it says couldnt be able to send it please retry So if Slack doesnt mean to enhance their mobile app then just discontinue the app please,1
906,Since the last update there is a serious problem with constructing messages as you cannot easily move around the text field to correct typos or edit what you have written Like another reviewer mentioned its feels like there is a problem with the screen recognising a tap but it is fine on my other apps Workaround is to long press as if you are highlighting a word but this is really time consuming Borderline unusable unless writing short simple replies Im on a Samsung Galaxy S9,2
907,Usefull corporate app and a standard in the industry Though I hate that the app is not androidoriented We android users use the back button a lot but in Slack it takes us out of the application instead of the previous screen within Slack Extremely annoying The back button is rendered USELESS BAD UX DESIGN there Every channel should be accessible more easily and behave more like a common messaging app like whatsapp I hate having to press the logo button to get the list of channels then if I want to get back to the list I cant use the back button REALLY BAD UX DESIGN for a productivity app Its really designed for iOS users,2
908,When slack works it is great for IM both for work and private I use it everyday However it is awkward to deal with anything else like files and search I am having issues with the app on my phone not receiving notifications at all or too late channels stop updating and bad performance The support unfortunately have only confirmed that these are indeed bugs and there is no fix as of yet,3
909,Ever since the last update the app becomes unresponsive It lags when you type Ive never had to close and then restart the app as much as I have to do now Ive been using it basically since the beginning on different mobile devices always worked really well until now If I didnt use Slack so much I would uninstall the app completely Extremely frustrating Please fix ASAP Update  everything is working again as expected after the last update Thanks for the fix,1
910,Very buggy thing Cannot join to new workspaces with invitation links: shows Uh oh something went wrong message or requires to create a new account if I open a link from an email client Sometimes sluggish takes long time to load a channel and then to scroll a messages history Same for a PC browser version Idea was good but the realization is Meh Alternative apps work better,1
911,I am not able to install Even it has downloaded to 98 % I did all fixes mentioned over web from slack I had sent feedback as well I had sent a reminder today 7th Oct 21,1
912,All of a sudden in the last few days it has started to hang when I use it for more than 5secs Since my mobile battery has been draining very quickly lately I checked the battery consumption stats It is using 67% of the battery Guessing that there could be a bug in one of the recent releases Pls check asap and provide a hotfix pkg if that is the case I would have to uninstall this app for now,2
913,* Battery consumption is high My phone tells it periodically * Does not support even Android 7 * Wants many permissions mostly unnecessary,2
914,Latest update is woeful Does not sync from computer correctly Ive missed already received text from another client (MacBook desktop version also up to date) Vs my OnePlus 8 Pro also the gestures on the OnePlus device (waterfall screen) require you to swipe in from the outside of the screen in which means the side menu is inaccessible your previous version didnt close when you swiped in it allowed you to go back to your conversation list This is now not possible roll it back,1
915,Stopped working for Samsung Galaxy A5 Recently it has started crashing all the time and I just cant type on it Its not usable at all and should be fixed It is causing to many issues My OS tells me it uses 4% of the battery It has stopped responding 10 times in a day It looks like memory leak issue which should be looked at I cant try and reinstall the app at this stage,1
916,Good app One star because I have to use my phone in landscape mode and theres a thick white horizontal bar doing nothing near the top of the screen I wish I could remove it somehow (Im using a Gemini PDA device) edit I emailed and its a known problem with no eta for when it will be fixed Will change Star rating when its fixed,1
917,New update messed everything Not able to use the app getting os version not supported However desktop version works just fine,1
918,1 The app if just slow why it cant be more like Whatsapp 2 Offline / no internet is unrelaiable you should alsodo it like whatsapp does where i can count on it being sent whenever i have inyernet again 3 Please add a mark as read button to push notifications not hard to do and SUPER productive now i have to get inside the app to mark it as read,3
919,New interface is horrible It used to be that you could seamlessly swap between laptop and phone and comfortably use a familiar interface While Im open to relearning an interface like how FB has revamped theirs on multiple occasions the deal breaker for me here is the simple fact that I cant even see messages I get notifications for on my phone I get notified then when I load the app and chat it doesnt show the new messages Which means I have to boot up my laptop to reply Ridiculous,1
920,Bug  Open app from the notification bar Type in reply Press back And its looping with the same screen and not getting exit,1
921,The latest update fails to give me notification for new messages I get notified maybe half hour later even then when i open my DM it is empty I got notified but the message is not there for another 1 hour It is not syncronized with my desktop slack as well When i receive DMs in bulk the notification keeps coming 1 by 1 for a long time Major sync issues in app,1
922,The change logs are awesome,5
923,Great laptop app On mobile however the menu chats are gone I cant see any icons or titles or text save for some green dots indicating when someone is online This may be because of my phone as it is an older model Nevetheless the app is still useable and I enjoy it save for some bugs and annoyances Its worth mentioning that I use it as an employee Had I been paying for this I dont think Id be as ambivalent,4
924,I think this is a really great tool and I love it Please fix the part where the app takes me down to recent messages im a channel when Im trying to go tbrough old chats,5
925,Worst business app ever When I receive a call on a multiple devices and answer from one of them the other devices should stop ringing Inst was they keep ringing for almost a minute so that it is impossible to talk with the person on the other side Also it doesnt synchronise immediately if you read one message in one device you still get the notification in the others Rubbish,1
926,The app is very good for team collaboration and new members can easily sign up to join the workspace However I have a few suggestions The channel names must allow spaces and capital letters so that it is easier to find a particular channel The distinction between consecutive messages are somewhat obscure and it is difficult to select and edit the right message without mistaking the nearby message Despite these shortcomings I will give the app a five star rating,4
927,712 is stable popular android version I still get updates for my Honor 8 and you get rid of support this androids dont understand why you did this,4
928,The mobile and desktop apps are both very glitchy The worst part of the mobile app is that I frequently get red notifications that my messages didnt send properly and I need to click to resend them Except they did send And I have no way of removing the errors other than to resend the same messages They just collect at the bottom of the conversation window I wish we would just go back to using skype,2
929,I am using both the desktop version and the phone version What is frustrating is that the slack on my phone refreshes recent notification so late I need to close and open it again to see the new messages on the different channels and it is so time consuming and it causes delay to give updates to those messages Another thing is notifications on my slack phone are showing not real time I hope this will be fixed asap for it is so stressful to us users of this platform Thank you,2
930,I successfully used Slack on my phone for over a year Then I got the notification that I can no longer use it on my device This is very disappointing An app forcing me to buy a new device feels like its really the wrong way round,1
931,This app would be great if it wasnt for the dreadful issue with notifications I have been using this app for over 3 years at this point And everything about the app itself is nice and featurefull It has message channels a desktop version file sharing formatting search history a nice interface etc However when you send a message you can pretty much guarantee it will not be seen any time soon The actual message is sent but nobody will notice until they open the app themselves manually There have been too many times when important messages have been missed and time has been wasted Due to this we have had to resort to standard text messages for any critical or important messages I have been holding out hope that this issue will one day be fixed but at this point Ive given up This has been a problem since at least December 2018 but from what I can tell from searching the internet this goes back to 2016 We have followed all instructions given by Slack about battery optimisation settings etc but these have made no difference This is the only messaging app that has any issues with push notifications so I feel this must be an issue with the app itself Until Slack do something to fix these issues I advise users to be aware,3
932,No longer compatible with my phone and instead of opening in the browser it redirects me here Very annoying as until they updated it worked fine,2
933,I use Slack on my desktop (browser) and the mobile app and its very frustrating that notifications arent in sync anymore My phone still shows notifications that I read hours ago in the browser I know that this affects our entire team (not sure about iOS) Please fix this this used to work in the past I had mixed feelings about the new UI but Im actually fine with it now (Though not sure if its a good idea to have a nonstandard navigation for the average user),3
934,Very unintuitive I tried signing in with a magic link half an hour has passed I did not receive the magic link in email I tried the manual signin doesnt work (it says it cant find anything for my email address) There may be an explanation but I dont know and I dont care If the sign in process is a burden its just now worth my time,1
935,I really dont like the new UI and im a developer so im open minded Swipping often doesnt work as intended there are drafts that are not drafts i cant delete them and they always show as unseen Trying to move the cursor in RTE is swiping the screen its really painfull There is not enough contrast much harder to follow the text too much white in the day theme For me a big step back 2 stars untill the issues are fixed at least,2
936,A few issues that i have experienced in the app: 1 The notifications are a bit slower than the mac version 2 The feed doesnt update sometimes there is a lag in a message being posted and it showing up on my channels 3 Sometimes I view a message but it shows up as unread and the notification dot stays on the icon I hope these issues are resolved Happy to give a 5 star rating then :),4
937,It is the perfect tool for groups working together on a project because it sorts in the most efficient way the messages sent (you can create the so called channels in which you discuss only on this topic) and the files are all gathered in one place so that you can return at any point and find them easily you can even search them by who sent the files Only thing I would want to be added is to have a notification on whether the messages have been read by the other members,5
938,The mobile and desktop apps really need to be streamlined Mobile notifications for messages I already read on desktop dont get cleared so I end up having to read through and clear the redundant notifications on my phone Not exactly a good use of time I like Slack but with the shift to work from home I get more messages and notifications than ever and this is getting really annoying,2
939,From last midnight I am facing the issue and due to this we are not able to connect with multiple clients in web as well as in mobile app  slack desktop app showing DNS issue as DNSPROBEFINISHEDNXDOMAIN,1
940,VERY buggy experience Clicking on a channel takes me to another channel often Notifications sometimes doesnt work sometimes it sends a high prio push for every single message Loading images is always megaslow Calling is unusable (zoom hangouts etc works fine) keeps ringing even though you picked up takes ages to connect huge delays Cant believe this is a paid product by a company worth 23 billion USD,1
941,Before this latest update the app worked generally well and Id rate it at 4 stars but after this update something has gone haywire The new version seems to have issues with syncing Ill see that I have a message but I when go to the channel where the message is supposed to be it doesnt update to show the new messages at all I have a Samsung s10,2
942,Its not bad but few features can be improved for example you try to send a message in a thread and decide not to later this will be shown like draft at the top It stays there forever and I dont know how to get rid of the draft state You should atleast have a way to clear drafts and then proceed I found another one that is supporting reactions in threads which I would like to use it quite a lot There are certain minor changes needed  may be your test suite needs improvement,3
943,The concept is good but execution is poor Standard chatting features such as replying to comments are missing This is unacceptable for an app in 2020 especially one that wants to be used for collaboration The channel feature is neat but discord does a better job by having servers and different channels within them that are further broken by text and voice channels Slack does some things right but fails in a lot more Hopefully they are working to catch up on a lot of these features in 2020,2
944,Single account works seamlessly on all your devices What a joy to use Once you use this app you will want to migrate all your group chats to this platform Easier faster and better organized compared to others If you work or chat among group of workers or friends with similar interests go for Slack Save time concentrate on what really matters  escape the nightmares of chat overload from some other apps My wishlist: Please can you provide the option of changing the background image,5
945,Not great not terrible Gets the job done It is more or less the standard for corporative communication and it is decent enough I had a small issue recently While seeing up Slack for the Work Profile I was unable to login into a workspace using Google The cause  I had no browser installed in the Work Profile After installing Chrome I was able to login Maybe show an error telling user to install the browser I was genuinely confused Some clarity about the issue would be great,3
946,There are some serious issues with this app which make it nearly useless First if theres a notification and I click on it the latest Messages are not shown for some reason Also even if I already read some messages they are still shown as unread Sometimes messages are not sent but they are shown as sent,2
947,About software the desktop app is great if you dont mind compromising huge amount of ram for just a messaging app The phone app is slow needs constant internet to work sending images is a pain I wouldnt recommend slack if you want to increase productivity in your company It is not a project manager tool Slack is not customizable and all its integrations are just half way developed,2
948,The latest call screen UI update is completely sick  the most used buttons (loudspeaker on/off and mic mute) have been hidden into menus or just started to hide in idle Shall I explain that on every single call now I have to make a series of taps  slides and now I cant see whether Im muted or not when it hides the mic button This also involves an extra delay to unmute Please hire a UX expert and do some tests before doing UI decisions,1
949,It would be nice if there was an option to record voice messages ** Nuisance: when I press backwards in my android I am thrown out of the app instead of going backwards to the messages list ** Nuisance: I dont see a list of last messaged people in chronological order but randomly This drives me crazy,1
950,No ones talking to me about my problems with the way their system is setup I do have a personal life that I need maintain,4
951,The only app that I have major login issues with I am an enterprise user under a corporate account All but one workspace is said to be not found after I did the activate workflow When I tried logging into last workspace it thinks I am using a rooted device when I am not What a disaster App is very overhyped Update: Slack also dropped support for Android 5 Now its guaranteed that I cant use my phone for work Good job guys Thats 5% of userbase and 1 in 20 customers,1
952,Giving a 1 star rating to hopefully have my issue addressed On mobile I will see a notification that I have a new Direct Message but when I open the conversation there is nothing there It could take minutes or even hours for the new DM Im being notified about to actually load I usually give up for a while and have to check back later This is extremely frustrating My boss mentioned the other day he has the same issue as well (both Android but totally different phones),1
953,Got this on the new Pixel 4 XL when in landscape mode there a rather big and ugly white bar between the workspace name and the channel name Please fix EDIT: Review post redesign exactly the same problem as before in landscape mode But frankly its nothing compared to the sync issue it now has Channels are never in sync Im at the point where using the web from my phones browser is a much better experience,2
954,This app just simply doesn’t care if I have allowed the data access or not Despite completely stopping the access to mobile data and wifi it still runs in the background connects with the internet and receives the texts Extremely intrusive and not something to have installed on your phone If this is how it behaves then it cant be trusted Uninstalled,1
955,More bugs than the natural history museum Downloaded yesterday for the first time and started a call with a colleague After 10 minutes the call dropped and I tried calling back at the same time I received a call I answered the call but my other call was still ringing in the background Happened 4 times in an hour Tried to close the call and it added me in twice to the same call Tried closing the app but it stayed open and the call continued in the background Not impressed Uninstalled,1
956,I use slack a lot but struggle with faster navigation on both desktop  mobile Please consider being able to collapse the left hand menu main items (starred channels direct message) scrolling down these is as pain as my lists are long also one should be able to go back to last 23 posts/discussions you were in easier as intuitively many check back what they wrote or want to read again the discussion The amount of clicking to get to things slack is too much Can you fix,3
957,I love using the app on my phone Whenever Im away from campus I still get the same experience So I cant fault the app at all What sucks is that if I wanted to quickly glance whats new about the lastest update I have to navigate out of the Play Store app which I find inconvenient Thats just as bad as having the same info from a previous update IMO,3
958,One would think it would be hard to screw up an IM app But slack shows that its possible The app randomly crashes on my Galaxy S20 notifications wont go away when viewed on other devices or worse off disappear randomly and turning off battery optimisation drains a third of my battery every day while telegram remains at 17% The workspace system is a complete mess I have no idea who thaught that this implementation is a good idea Sadly Im forced to use it by my company,1
959,Completely unreliable Notifications arrive in bulk even if I have seen them before If a message fails to send because of no internet it never succeeds to send again even if the app is in the foreground Not all messages are shown even if I am connected I have to close the app multiple times and open it again to finally see the messages If really try not to use it Please fix I happy to provide more info if needed,1
960,With the latest updates the app is pretty much unusable for me Notications show but when I open the app it renders an endless loading loop I reinstalled it which made it work for a while I then downloaded the latest update which brought it back to the same useless state Edit: 4 months later still doesnt work properly  No loading loop but messages and usernames are missing among other things,1
961,We use Slack extensively for online meetings When Im invited to a call my phone starts ringing which is as I would expect but it sometimes wont stop ringing for a minute after I join the call on another device Theres no way for me to stop this ringing by myself Highly irritating when youre in the call and want to speak,2
962,Has been crashing for 2 years now when: (i) switching away from the app (ii) sending the app in background or (iii) locking the phone while the app is open Consequently notifications for new messages dont work (while the app is crashed) No other chat app suffers the same predicament on this phone (running Android 6) Diabolical app too bad I have to to use it b/c company/work,1
963,Well its a very good app Though I found a bug in it When someone wants to see that how many people are in the workspace and click on people button App shows all people in a repeatable manner means once list finishes of people It starts again again I m using this app in my SAMSUNG M30 phone Due to this I cant see all my colleagues in workspace,4
964,No way to sign out the damn thing,1
965,The new design is terrible and the biggest waste of time and space since Trump became president Unnecessary and often unregistered swipes all over the place only to get to and fro the channels The previous design was great and had little to no flaws workflow was optimal and I highly encourage you to include an option for the old design to allow proper functionality Forcing a half broken and frankly ineffective UI onto the users whereas the previous was just fine just isnt the way to go,1
966,For me this is a very good app and I can see what the messages are and videos and I dont need another post if I want to replyi can just click on the message and I will get option to replyand it can happen any timeyou can reply and post any timeand you knowyou will not be able to see time of when the message is sent so even if somebody does send in the middle of night then nobody else will know that,4
967,Smooth and user friendly especially the new interface but would like the create group chat option to be improved When adding a new member a new group shouldnt have to be created again the same group should just continue to exist having so much inactive chats on ur display wont look nice Hope you guys understand what I am trying to say I love ur app anyway though,3
968,I cant navigate in the app after the latest update because the size of the application is wrong Its too big so the bottom and top of the app have the OS/System buttons over them I cant type messages because the typing bar has the OS buttons on top of it Hope they fix it soon because I cant use it as it is now,2
969,Almost 4/5 times when I send images from my phone to a channel or to someone in private the image gets sent but when I open Slack (on the phone) the channel or private chat has an error Couldnt send Tap to try again I dont want to tap it since the image has already been sent and received I also dont know any way around the issue other than uninstalling the app Its super annoying I will change my rating to 5 stars once this has been fixed,1
970,App worked really well until i recieved a request for a new workspace (logged in using my Google Account) tried the email the link but this just defaults to a login screen and keeps going round in circles and requesting that I log in with my URL User Name and Password which I do not have as I am logged in with a Google Account frustrating I can not use this on my phone anymore so I have to look at slack on my computer  now given up and sending normal emails and using the phone let me know when this is fixed sent an email to the support and they answered in a couple of hours logged in using the mobile browser then the app opened up without problems  thanks  an extra four stars for the quick service,2
971,Its a big shame about the redesign For people with adhd and focus problems it is now extremely hard to differentiate anything in the app I woke up this morning with an important msg to send our client and it took me ages to figure out how to do it So thanks for that Also the new ux writing try swiping to the right is so condescending When will tech companies realise using the word try suggests the user is too stupid to know how to swipe FYI we dont need it I want old slack back,1
972,The app is pretty ok What i dont like is the shady approach the developers use to make you update I have noticed that the moment there is an update available the app on the phone begins to malfunction till it becomes unbearable and the owner would have to update There are many other apps on the market that do not have such a nasty ploy,3
973,App not working on Android 60 (yeah I know its old but I still use my phone cuz its doing its job) App were fine before latest update,3
974,Stop changing your interface Its annoying to get used to it and its never better than the previous one Update: Slowly getting used to the new layout Some things are better But the tapping/swiping behavior is bad Its very difficult to tap on anything as its detected as a swipe Please fix this,2
975,Great UI Awful experience The app is really useful and good looking but does that matter for a chatting app if you cant rely on its notifications Slack notifications on android are really unreliable they arrive late out of order or dont even arrive Ive tried everything from reinstalling to switching phones my coworkers report similar problems its simply unusable since you cant trust it Remember this is a paid enterprise chatting solution so this kind behavior is unexcusable,1
976,This app is really great but after the latest update I can no longer make/join calls through my bluetooth headset nor can I change the sound from speaker to regular phone This basically means that Im not able to join any calls unless Im seated at my desk which defeats a big part of the purpose of having the app in the first place,2
977,Terrible app I only use it because of work but there are so many bad things about it Notifications not received notification arrives but new message in the chat not displayed even if I answered to a channel still shows the last dozen as unread sometimes not all unread messages are loaded so you get various popups with different numbers and the screen jumps to different messages Bad overall,1
978,I have had a remarkably frustrating experience with your recent updates pushed to mobile and desktop apps Both updates have made your apps unusable,1
979,Overall very good app But : 1 Sometimes I dont receive notifications (Im using Huawei Mate 20 pro) up untill I start the app and then I see that there are new messages 2 Not being able to add / remove people from group chat thus being forced to create new one with the same member + /  that one is pretty annoying Fix this please :),4
980,After I work on my computer I go online on my phone and Slack is notifying me all messages I had during my work There is no option to block the irrelevant messages notification except to totally block all Slack notifications which I cannot do as I need to be notified of new messages The notifications setting I have is for mentions direct message and only Can you fix this annoyance please,1
981,The old user experience was good the current user experience just like annoying me if I download something I cant open in my desktop folder I have to go to the downloads folder and find the item there that I have downloaded from slack I am UI UX designer I have to upload and download hundreds of documents in daily basis from my clients but I am seeing the user experience of slack is getting worse day by day I think I should look for another way to not to face this problem in future,2
982,Notifications are a lottery I get them from some channels but not others and if youre logged in to multiple workspaces they dont seem to work reliably at all The Troubleshoot notifications option doesnt find errors It hints that battery saving features might be the culprit but somehow every other chat app manages to work The bottom row of emojis in the emoji picker gets hidden under the OS navigation bar,2
983,Great UI lackluster UX Sometimes when trying to send a picture it will say could not be sent Thats fine except if you sent it on the mobile app theres no way to delete that msg and its stickied to the bottom of the conversation until to reinstall the app Also answering a call on the web app can leave the mobile app in a state where it endlessly rings (vibrates) and I have to kill the process to stop it,2
984,Had to move this app to a dedicated work device due to heavy resource usage leading to rapid battery drain I appreciate that a collaboration tool needs to stay active but hogging the whole device is unacceptable without deeper sleep options when running in background I appreciate that this is probably not the developer or Googles fault as Android is notorious for these kinds of battery/sleep issues with background apps on some devices Maybe NFT/PO test more device vendor/version combos,2
985,All kinds of reliability problems that makes it not usable on my mobile device but the most problematic one is that Im getting notifications for new messages but those new messages are not being displayed I need to open my laptop to see them Sometimes subset of the messages are displayed which causing get partial data without knowing I didnt get it all I wish I could uninstall but my org forces me to use it Shame on you Slack,2
986,The WYSIWYG editor on mobile has gotten so bad on Slack mobile recently I often find myself typing foo| (where | is my cursor) and hitting space and the words I type afterwards are still rendered in monospace I then try to highlight the text after foo and tap the button to turn off monospace which seems to work but then I type one more character and it all turns monospace again Why is there no option to disable the WYSIWYG editor on the mobile I just want plain Markdown,2
987,You guys really need to make a lot of improvements The desktop app is superb But your android app is pathetic I see a dot I go and check the message and then I still see the dot Sometimes the dot is there but the chats are not synced I have to go and check my computer This is not we use a mobile app for Please fix it or drop the android app,2
988,Really like the latest UI The 3 compartments and the easy slidinggliding interface DO NOT CHANGE this And before adding release a beta tester for few people and check with them if it is better or worse than the existing one With the current one I feel it is getting easier to use slack on mobile than on laptop,4
989,Instantly it stopped working with my Android 7 No warnings in advance nothing to give me time to migrate,1
990,Its an allright app but its slow can be heavy on phone resources such as RAM How is it also possible that a popular message app cannot handle sending multiple images Currently a pain Im sure they can add it Right Please squeeze some more fixes into your releases rather than just logo / cosmetic changes \o/,3
991,Hi Slack I love your app theres a notification problem on Android I wont hammer that as others have extensively reported My issue occurs when you want to cancel a failed upload You dont get the option to cancel except to tap and try again That may be the expected but not all the time Kindly provide a way to cancel such uploads,1
992,Every time the app updates there seems to be a new and exciting Notification Category that defaults to full volume and invariably sounds i the middle of the night when I am trying to sleep Not sure why the devs have decided that new notification categories should override my existing settings but there it is If I didnt need the app Id delete it,4
993,Very easy to use user friendly interface and havent seen it getting hanging too Just have one issue please reply I have set all notifications to silent but then too slack downloads the 12 notification sounds These sounds come into my so gs playlist which I dont want so I delete them from file manager but slack downloads them back within 12 days So eventually Im deleting the same 12 sound files everyday is there any permanent solution to this Thanks :),4
994,Total shite Awful interface lacking any true customisation yet another chat app that brings nothing new to the table and steals ideas from discord an exercise in reinventing the wheel which hasnt been updated in years and crashes all the time Also I wouldnt trust this app if you value your privacy Avoid like the plague,1
995,Mobile push notifications are not happening please resolve that as early as possible As you guys already know the importance of the I wish the problem is fixed at the earliest I tried troubleshooting this issue over my phone Issue still persist please do consider this as a serious problem,1
996,Its really good if you include CROP option in the chat window along with other options Its bit difficult using printscreen and copy paste that pic to send to others as total screen pic appears and then we need crop manually using any tool and then send If crop option is included in the chat window along with other options we can instantly send only required portion of pic or data and will be with ease for daily work,3
997,Its not a great android app Works great at work on pc but lots of bugs on android Most annoying for me is everytime I send a picture with the android app it works fine but says it has failed now I can either press to send again (the recipient will get the picture again) or be left with a notification saying it has failed At least at give an option to remove the notification but better yet fix the bug,2
998,Been good so far No issues I also love the fact that its saves conversations on Google Drive,5
999,It just sucks The app is confusing to use and makes no logical sense I try to start a new message to someone and it only lets me select a group chat theyre in It doesnt keep up to date with slack on my computer so I have 150 unread messages I really like using it on the computer,1
