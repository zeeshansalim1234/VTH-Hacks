0,More stable than in the past but more frustrating to use My Firefox is stuck in a fullscreen activity and I cant find how to turn it off The UI and user options are completely trash and even less intuitive to navigate than the desktop Firefox Mozilla seems to have become a feckless organization and I will no longer be donating What an absolute joke I hope you replace the person Making such outdated and horrible decisions,0.9730732616091285,0.012856324716883987,0.014070413673987444
1,Its getting better but after the most recent updates the search engines wont hold their settings I dont seem to have the same problem in chrome or other browsers Ive tried It only seems to be firefox that has this problem I can open the settings page in any of the searches: google bing duck duck go and turn safe search on off or strict when I hit save it all goes back to default and wont save settings I hope you can address this issue in an update,0.00998597098291827,0.9798377371374568,0.01017629187962496
2,This app used to be great but not anymore Just another example of software engineers constantly changing things to justify their jobs They have moved the back forward and refresh buttons into the three dots menu making it a pain to use these basic functions Overall the app has become the opposite of why I liked it in the first place Uninstalling it for now Ill try back again in a year maybe,0.8099399611339514,0.013008413363841115,0.17705162550220746
3,I used to love the app until the last update The browser hides the android buttons for back and home along the bottom of my screen and the time signal and battery icons along the top screen Change it so you have the option of setting your custom settings to not having to swipe down to back up I dont need another quarter inch of screen space I would much rather be able to back up or go to menu in a single motion or I dont know be able to see if I am still connected to the internet,0.9793535100003674,0.010307864765154532,0.010338625234478017
4,The UI is miserable its so taxing to navigate anywhere within the settings Options like Print page and Search through Bookmarks are gone The Bookmark manu looks awful and handles like its from the 90s Cant figure out how to pull up desktop tabs now Theres great lack of addons now Data collection is on by default No data saving web compression feature like Chrome History has no sorting or search feature,0.22624063983673215,0.6025297962435021,0.17122956391976568
5,With the latest update Why did they hide the back button Now if i want to go back i need to swipe downward first to show the buttons then hit back It doubles the action to back up Every Single Time Please do something in settings to allow me to opt out of that choice My screen is huge and Ill keep the buttons at the bottom thank you,0.9669025959053157,0.016730284308166407,0.01636711978651785
6,I like the app but the browser sometimes hangs quite a bit before loading the site and has trouble loading pictures on quite a few gaming sites I dont like having a bookmark list for desktop and a different one for mobile It annoyingly generates tabs like crazy Video doesnt look as good as on Chrome and loads much slower The UI is a bit ugly and shouldnt just copy Chrome Vivaldi is a much better alternative at the moment I want nothing but endless bookmark icons on my homepage,0.05349747288015077,0.25665575953143877,0.6898467675884105
7,The only reason I have this app on my phone is for a plugin called ublock origin Otherwise I wouldnt waste my time Seems that Mozilla has lost their competence when it comes to writing good browsers Probably only a matter of time before they break the only functionality they have that makes having their product on my phone worth it How about it Mozilla How long until you break Firefox enough for me to completely wipe it off all my systems You guys spent years earning this review,0.009711095848210562,0.0106332223680244,0.9796556817837649

10,Big time and longtime FF user but like the desktop the mobile version isnt good in the latest versions Im using v88 on desktop still and going to just install an older apk for mobile Sorry FF devs You keep trying to make it better but you just screw up what worked perfectly fine update after update and added more nonsense flair and options that are just not needed Stop ruining you applications NOT EVERYTHING IN THIS WORLD NEEDS TO BE CHANGED /IMPROVED Yes caps cause you all need it,0.008185314963864364,0.11449345160545872,0.8773212334306769
11,With the latest update any time I play a video or game within the browser it stays in full screen mode after  so any webpage hides the notifications at the top of screen More importantly it hides the edge panel so I can switch apps rapidly I can reset it out of full screen mode under settings by reenabling navigation buttons but thats tedious after every time I view a video And I thought Id never have to go back to Chrome ,0.9779002377439504,0.010970356497783577,0.011129405758266018
12,Pretty good but some annoying bugs: 1 With the Firefox toolbar at the bottom some menu options recently became unusable because theyre covered by on screen Android buttons and 2 Desktop site for pages gets mixed up sometimes when switching tabs with other tabs taking over the desktop view tab or desktop site option just not giving a desktop view after going to another tab then returning to the tab thats using the desktop site option,0.37065898662507984,0.00859827713968472,0.6207427362352353
13,Refresh issue: When I temporarily exit the browser to view another app and then return to the browser it refreshes the web page For example I was trying to obtain a 2FA verification code received from a text to then paste into the browser the web page refreshed forcing me to obtain another verification code The issue persisted leaving me in an endless loop New update has Firefox constantly opening in Full screen mode Does work when you dont have physical buttons,0.6899065482888389,0.30142529371195,0.008668157999211185

16,Updates w/ features seem to cause problems that never shouldve got off the drawing board but the ability to watch YouTube videos without ads using addons earns them a 35/5 despite becoming increasingly battery hungry Too bad they have to compete with Brave or theyd win but sorry Brave is a better mobile browser,0.2726355781593212,0.602120746821296,0.1252436750193827

18,I have no idea how or why your programmers have completely lost their minds about tabs and website browsing Nobody needs a new tab evert time a link is clicked or a website is searched Absolutely frustrating Also it is insane to eliminate the ability to backup inside a website The new versions just jump between websites making the backup button completely useless for browsing Congratulations I absolution hate this browser now,0.015008774864058716,0.9714164418961869,0.01357478323975441

314,UPD: back to 5 stars They fixed the annoying forced full screen I changed my fivestar review to two stars because of the latest update It keeps going full screen which pisses me off In terms of going back to home screen Ive got to freakingly swipe up two times not mentioning that the first swipe scrolls the heck out of the page to the end of the screen which I didnt intend to do Firefox What the hell starting today Im using a different browser Thank you,0.5618246059969787,0.010230105719420556,0.4279452882836007
315,More update with less UI customization that was a reason why I use firefox over other browser New UI is optimized for bottom bar When I choose a TOP address bar Im expexted other menu at the top too Also I dont want to see anything in new page except blank Collection tab is a matter of privacy too Update: Still the same tab list is still optimized for bottom menu,0.014585088489955598,0.9729928126208199,0.012422098889224367

317,Used Firefox for years on various platforms On Android it has become rubbish It has become visually unappealing no longer shows all the tabs that have not been manually closed and arbitrarily deletes older ones It was worth 5 stars now its not really worth 1 I really would like to continue using it but not as it has become DuckDuckGo is going to be my goto browser from now on alternatively I may also consider Chrome a browser I have never liked,0.011865324879985772,0.23731636311984733,0.750818312000167
318,Been a firefox user ever since i converted but after the recent update my notification bar and buttons at the bottom disappeared Its extremely inconvenient to go back pages now with this The bottom bar actually does not take much space and needing to slide up everytime i wish to go back a page is quite convenient The extra space honestly doesnt do any good Hope the next update will revert it back to normal,0.2667477232741104,0.7195701623377027,0.01368211438818696
319,I love Firefox and have always preferred it However the latest update which causes the back button to disappear (you have to slide up from the bottom) is stupid and not something I can imagine a lot of people have asked for The silly goal of trying to maximise screen space at any cost results in a very poor user experience People always want to go back and forth between websites and making it harder isnt the way to do that This + the change to websites being in groups = bad UI,0.7224855071720355,0.26663127039772894,0.010883222430235368
320,Mozillas perseverance down a riskier but more innovative path should be applauded and thankfully its slowly finding its feet again Currently the only thing keeping me from Firefox as primary driver is atrocitious Android tablet usability  no desktop mode lock tab bar etc Also please bring back groups Chromium tab stacking is invaluable and the awkwardness of containers doesnt cut the mustard,0.297055575205837,0.4444620884077763,0.2584823363863868
321,The browser is great but it still suffers from the same problem which always been famous for on all operating systems from the day one After a while its speed slows down dramatically and takes up a lot of RAM space In particular the start up and opening speed slows to the point of regret But still its my default browser on phone and pc,0.015460959023624534,0.9672485051726414,0.017290535803733985
322,Version 9710 broke full screen video on Samsung Galaxy S10 Lite These problems dont occur in Chrome 1 When I play a video full screen with the phone in landscape orientation the video doesnt take up the full height of the screen so the video is smaller than it should be 2 When I exit full screen mode and turn the phone back to portrait orientation the Android Navigation Bar is not present So Im stuck in Firefox and cant do anything else with my phone,0.9789459477787705,0.01025736659734972,0.01079668562387974
323,Not bad Recently switched to Firefox after years using Yandex Firefox is slower and lacks Yandexs killer textreflow But at least it respects my choices by allowing me to install the extensions I want and doesnt bombard me with a moronic news feed full of vacant zzzelebrity junk every time I install an update Just get a decent textreflow function added will you Many websites are literally impossible to read on a tiny phone screen Why do so few browsers take this into account,0.975862456332777,0.010367329681078558,0.013770213986144449
324,Long time FF user Mobile app is just a bit rubbish its uncomfortable to use with the gestures for tab management requiring use of the whole screen The addons are a joke theres 17 of rhem Presumably this limit of whitelisted apps is due to the underlying method being problematic with security or stability Customisation of button layout again is limited Its missing most of what makes the desktop app good,0.21353892205793926,0.011867916996442716,0.774593160945618
325,I use Firefox all the time mostly so I can just listen to music with the Google browser in the background without having the music stopping like YouTube However an annoying thing that does happen is that the music stops when theres an ad in one of my other apps Its really annoying when I have to go back and restart it since I normally use desktop mode to listen to music in the background but when I go back to fix the issue it goes to mobile mode and wont go back on to desktop mode,0.9808965663333331,0.009346985620916912,0.009756448045749948
326,Im having a problem after the last app update It keeps going full screen when I use it so I cant see the home button and back space key on my phone at the bottom or any of the icons at the top for time and internet connectivity This makes switching out of the app cumbersome and frustrating How do I change this feature It only happens with this internet app,0.9708289282540373,0.012716333116322958,0.016454738629639722
327,I really like the new homepage with top sites and collections And clicking the search bar to access them is fantastic thats a great feature that other browsers dont have However when I click a top site or collection page it opens in a new tab instead of the same page This is so irritating You end up with 20 tabs on every session Its really annoying Please include an option to customise this,0.26561780355257836,0.3844009495943746,0.34998124685304716
328,Update: Broken Sometimes when switching tasks the webpage will turn black and then even if I restart the app it will not respond Only way to fix it is to forcekill firefox in the OS settings Its been several years since the redesign and just as before we still have no way to close tabs when exiting the app and addon support is basically nonexistant Im very sad that this is the state of mobile firefox but as of now Im switching to Vivaldi,0.2102800302464788,0.011435504679695339,0.7782844650738259

331,the loss of scroll position is incredibly annoying it took me forever to find the new bugzilla instead of the black hole feedback is currently directed to and by then I didnt have the energy to write anything now I dont even remember the other bugs I wanted to report still better than chrome Edit: FFS now its suddenly fullscreen and theres no option to turn it off :( OTOH it seems to lose my scroll position less often now,0.9754128971288811,0.011800279724401347,0.01278682314671752
332,App randomly (but regularly) goes into full screen mode hiding the entire android UI (including the home and back buttons) making it hard to switch to other apps or check notifications This is utterly frustrating and completely breaks the app This needs to be fixed before the app can be considered useable,0.9740510462332329,0.012733643242657232,0.013215310524109902

335,I really dislike this redesign and many things either dont work or are missing I hate having no homepage and have a guess where a bookmark saved If you use Bing it wont let it go back with gestures or the arrows You have to close that tab open a new one for Bing then you can navigate backwards Lots of security holes and not repaired fast enough Let it supply an insecure password without special chars The Fenix coders are not open to suggestions in Github The nag page of whats new,0.009875786211183499,0.011337480620263926,0.9787867331685526
