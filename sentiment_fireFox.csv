,review,sentiment
0,More stable than in the past but more frustrating to use My Firefox is stuck in a fullscreen activity and I cant find how to turn it off The UI and user options are completely trash and even less intuitive to navigate than the desktop Firefox Mozilla seems to have become a feckless organization and I will no longer be donating What an absolute joke I hope you replace the person Making such outdated and horrible decisions,2
1,Its getting better but after the most recent updates the search engines wont hold their settings I dont seem to have the same problem in chrome or other browsers Ive tried It only seems to be firefox that has this problem I can open the settings page in any of the searches: google bing duck duck go and turn safe search on off or strict when I hit save it all goes back to default and wont save settings I hope you can address this issue in an update,2
2,This app used to be great but not anymore Just another example of software engineers constantly changing things to justify their jobs They have moved the back forward and refresh buttons into the three dots menu making it a pain to use these basic functions Overall the app has become the opposite of why I liked it in the first place Uninstalling it for now Ill try back again in a year maybe,2
3,I used to love the app until the last update The browser hides the android buttons for back and home along the bottom of my screen and the time signal and battery icons along the top screen Change it so you have the option of setting your custom settings to not having to swipe down to back up I dont need another quarter inch of screen space I would much rather be able to back up or go to menu in a single motion or I dont know be able to see if I am still connected to the internet,3
4,The UI is miserable its so taxing to navigate anywhere within the settings Options like Print page and Search through Bookmarks are gone The Bookmark manu looks awful and handles like its from the 90s Cant figure out how to pull up desktop tabs now Theres great lack of addons now Data collection is on by default No data saving web compression feature like Chrome History has no sorting or search feature,1
5,Ive used Firefox for close to 15 years and it has always worked great for me When issues do arise a new update is always quickly added which I think has really only been twice in the years that I have used it Even then those were personal issues with layout changes and the next update added an option to go back or have something similar,5
6,With the latest update Why did they hide the back button Now if i want to go back i need to swipe downward first to show the buttons then hit back It doubles the action to back up Every Single Time Please do something in settings to allow me to opt out of that choice My screen is huge and Ill keep the buttons at the bottom thank you,1
7,I like the app but the browser sometimes hangs quite a bit before loading the site and has trouble loading pictures on quite a few gaming sites I dont like having a bookmark list for desktop and a different one for mobile It annoyingly generates tabs like crazy Video doesnt look as good as on Chrome and loads much slower The UI is a bit ugly and shouldnt just copy Chrome Vivaldi is a much better alternative at the moment I want nothing but endless bookmark icons on my homepage,3
8,Firefox has features that most other mobile browsers lack I like that it syncs bookmarks from the desktop version I also really like how easy it is to open a link in a new tab and switch to that tab from the link that pops up at the bottom of the page There have been a lot of improvements since launch The password API integration works much better now and its great to be able to use addons (especially adblockers) The only problem is that the addon selection is still very limited,4
9,The only reason I have this app on my phone is for a plugin called ublock origin Otherwise I wouldnt waste my time Seems that Mozilla has lost their competence when it comes to writing good browsers Probably only a matter of time before they break the only functionality they have that makes having their product on my phone worth it How about it Mozilla How long until you break Firefox enough for me to completely wipe it off all my systems You guys spent years earning this review,1
10,I want to like this browser so much Ive used it for over a year now But it is so unreliable Im finally uninstalling it today This browser just gets stuck Like all the time Tabs wont load new pages and must be completely closed because they become unusable Its been an issue forever and never been fixed See ya,1
11,My go to web browser on mobile and desktop Firefox is a more privacy minded browser than many others that works very well for browsing the web Because I use the browser across multiple devices I find sync helpful While I think there is always room for improvement this browser is pretty excellent Honestly my biggest reason for using Firefox is so that I dont depend to heavily on anyone company for my software needs,4
12,Broken it randomly hides android button bar then randomly shows it No option I can find to stop it Seems to be trying to force full screen whether I want it or not Yeah done with Firefox on mobile unusable I switched to the Brave browser has nice ad blocking renders fine And doesnt go fullscreen like Firefox does How that passed qa ill never know,1
13,Big time and longtime FF user but like the desktop the mobile version isnt good in the latest versions Im using v88 on desktop still and going to just install an older apk for mobile Sorry FF devs You keep trying to make it better but you just screw up what worked perfectly fine update after update and added more nonsense flair and options that are just not needed Stop ruining you applications NOT EVERYTHING IN THIS WORLD NEEDS TO BE CHANGED /IMPROVED Yes caps cause you all need it,3
14,Firefox now removes the buttons from Android and operates in a full screen mode making it so you cant read the time or see your battery nor can you easily access the home back and index buttons I dont know if this is a new feature or a new bug but it makes using the browser more of a hassle than a convenience,4
15,With the latest update any time I play a video or game within the browser it stays in full screen mode after  so any webpage hides the notifications at the top of screen More importantly it hides the edge panel so I can switch apps rapidly I can reset it out of full screen mode under settings by reenabling navigation buttons but thats tedious after every time I view a video And I thought Id never have to go back to Chrome ,1
16,Will update when I use it First hour in soUPDATE: Well almost 2 months using and its slowly growing on me Not too diff from my ex Chrome just more options bells n whistles (not literally min noise) Havent had any problems with ads or any real security notifs/alerts Would like an option for more customization of the Firefox Homepage though as I must use Googles search engine to stay abreast of my interests kinda defeating a browsers objective imho Rock on 🦊 🤟,4
17,Pretty good but some annoying bugs: 1 With the Firefox toolbar at the bottom some menu options recently became unusable because theyre covered by on screen Android buttons and 2 Desktop site for pages gets mixed up sometimes when switching tabs with other tabs taking over the desktop view tab or desktop site option just not giving a desktop view after going to another tab then returning to the tab thats using the desktop site option,3
18,I had written a review in 2020 and wanted to leave an update I have changed my one star review to five because the fine folk at Mozilla have since improved the Android version of Firefox tremendously since the last time I used it My original gripe with the then redesigned Firefox was that most of the previous abilities to tweak it had been removed Now they are back and Im once again a happy camper,5
19,I was using Google Chrome for my schooling and it wouldnt do everything I needed such as reading an Ebook to me while I was writing a paper on it Firefox reads off my book for me with no problem The only thing thats weird about Firefox is when my mouse is connected to my phone I hover the mouse over the page and it flashes a lot so you cant see where it is most of the time but it still works like its not flashing Still better than most all the other browsers Ive tried,4
20,Refresh issue: When I temporarily exit the browser to view another app and then return to the browser it refreshes the web page For example I was trying to obtain a 2FA verification code received from a text to then paste into the browser the web page refreshed forcing me to obtain another verification code The issue persisted leaving me in an endless loop New update has Firefox constantly opening in Full screen mode Does work when you dont have physical buttons,2
21,more private than Chrome works on more sites than ddg if you dont mind Google and all their advertisers knowing what youre doing every second of the day Chrome is more robust in terms of websites behaving the way you expect them to all that said Firefox is my default browser I wanted ddg to be my default but it doesnt work right with too many pages,2
22,I wish I could give it 6 stars Better than Chrome Allows addons and has more customization than Chrome Isnt owned by Google so it wont spy on your dreams while youre asleep Install Unlock Origin and never see the internet the same again (Literally) Highly recommended,4
23,Still keep crashing and very slow Only reason I was using it cause it better than Google tracking where u beenOnce I find way to import my favorite I unistLling this appCrash almost every time I use it Plus it very slowNo longer going to waste my time with this broswer Sent feed back when browser crash but so far that not help using it I give it half star if I could This browser need major work to improved before I ever try it again Works fine on my PC but windows tends to be slower,2
24,Updates w/ features seem to cause problems that never shouldve got off the drawing board but the ability to watch YouTube videos without ads using addons earns them a 35/5 despite becoming increasingly battery hungry Too bad they have to compete with Brave or theyd win but sorry Brave is a better mobile browser,3
25,Now my back and home buttons along with clock and battery status disappear unless you swipe on the top or bottom of the screen What a pain in the rear to use the back button on my s21 Completely ruined the browsing experience I want my factory samsung navigation buttons back,1
26,I have no idea how or why your programmers have completely lost their minds about tabs and website browsing Nobody needs a new tab evert time a link is clicked or a website is searched Absolutely frustrating Also it is insane to eliminate the ability to backup inside a website The new versions just jump between websites making the backup button completely useless for browsing Congratulations I absolution hate this browser now,1
27,why is it only one choice to OPEN LINKS IN APPS here should be a whitelist of sorts I dont want to go to the Play store every time I click A Track package Gmail Its gotten better recently I use Firefox on PC laptop and mobile 1 major bug: send tab to device from phone to PC last couple months while trying to select the device devices are there initially but they disappear immediately after saying offline I believe everything is synced it just stopped working couple months ago,1
28,Well I held off updating because of the addons that the new version breaks Somehow the new version was force updated on my tablet breaking the two addons that were most important to me Ill be uninstalling after I leave this review It was a good run firefox but youve gone a bit too far this time,3
29,Still Cant set new default homepage to bookmarks Mozilla has taken away all the common and useful features and addons for what Cant even close all tabs on exit Just stupid You have bean counters running the show and this is what you get from MozillaSoft Sticking to older version 6811 and using alternate browser Fix it,1
30,the new update sucks firefox used to be the only browser i needed and used but as of recently i cant open half my webpages cant use a page that involves live chat and if im lucky the page stays open for 25 minutes before crashing i cant do anything ive updated ive uninstalled and reinstalled and still happening and although my password has not changed i cannot sync and use my saved logins very frustrating,1
31,Love firefox my main complaint is that when opening a new tab its annoying that I cant choose what page opens unfortunately the extension newpage override doesnt work on android It would be nice if I could put in my own URL to go to when starting a new tab not just the options of 1 The firefox home feed or 2 A blank page,4
32,while its the only mobile browser that allows plugins its horribly limited as to the plugins it allows Also you cant print from it because they refuse to implement that feature even though Chrome has had it for years Also since the most recent update on or about Feb 1st 2022 almost every text box I enter text into lags for 1020 sec sometimes Ive tried cleaning up my phone memory and checking for an update to Firefox but nothing fixes it,2
33,I am a long time user I was using Mozilla before Firefox and Thunderbird were developed and way before Firefox for Android Firefox has been my go to browser for Linux Windows and Android Somehow is developing Firefox for Android the ability to print was lost What an omission A browser that cant print Stupid Developers are driving users to other browsers,1
34,maybe some of the under the hood changes are better but I HATE the new UI/UX and cannot change enough of it to an equivalent of what I used to have Here are a few really basic requests: let me set my homepage to bookmarks let me sort my bookmarks allow me to open bookmarks on a new tab (this used to work) the workaround of having to do a search first is hot garbage I am deeply disappointed that Firefox is following the race to the bottom for crappier UI,2
35,almost perfect but sadly will be switching out of Firefox for Android Websites seriously load way too slowly ton Android for some reason Desktop is fine My internet is fine too But for some reason whenever I click on links it takes forever to load However other browsers like Chrome load fast,3
36,Please implement Chromes Copy Image context menu action (menu that pops up after long pressing an image) Firefox only allows you to copy the URL of an image but sometimes Id like to copy the image directly to my clipboard Also PLEASE use the standard Android sharesheet I want to direct share to conversations but its overriden with this worse share sheet ,2
37,Bring back one click onscreen navigation Stop hiding my Android interface if you wont allow even the most basic functions of an internet browser There is such thing as dysfunctional minimalism and your UX team ought to be aware of that,1
38,FIREFOX said purchase page on Google and other websites wasnt secure connection Chrome said it was Whats up FF Was my connection secure or do people have access to my info now It said not secure but refreshing page changed it to secure and it would change back Main site secure then changed to insecure on PAYMENT page on Samsung website I find it hard to believe that the genuine Samsung purchase page isnt encrypted Whats the deal Yes its up to date Why support Shouldnt fail F++,1
39,I have struggled for several days trying to get my bookmarks imported from Chrome Beta and I give up I can import some but setting new bookmarks is next to impossible Why do I need to use my desktop to import them in the first place Adding bookmarks on Android wont work when trying to keep bookmarks organized in folders Going back to Chrome Beta,1
40,Taking away the back feature in the phone and it putting through the Firefox menu is horrible and especially doesnt work when videos are full screen This is making using the app cumbersome hope this gets fixed so I dont have to look for another browser,1
41,Once again the latest update breaks youtube videos because the fullscreen aspect ratio detection has been borked for the 500th time I absolutely DESPISE developers who dont understand the meaning of the phrase if it aint broke dont fix it I want to put it on a brick and smack these people over the head with it until it sinks in Update after update and things go from working fine to broken repeatedly Its at the point where im switching permanently over to a new browser,1
42,No way to export bookmarks without signing up for a Firefox account No longer supports most addons I see no reason to choose this browser over the other options but Im lockedin until I find a workaround for the bookmarks issue Then Ill uninstall,1
43,Absolutely trash since latest update Navigation buttons randomly being hidden or disappearing as browser forces itself to go full screen Full screen video is horrible They still continue to force those annoying Qr code scan and search engine buttons on people as you type taking up space for useless features,1
44,Constant crashing since last update Numerous script errors that eventually cause Firefox to slow to a crawl  or not respond forcing the closure of the app clearing the cache  trying to run it again Never had this issue prior to last update Updates appear to have corrected the issues,1
45,used to be great now it has many issues fullscreen has a blank space taking up the bottom of the screen and the app removes status bar of my phone on the top also firefox is working with meta (facebook) so im unfortunately going to uninstall after being a firefox user for 16 years,2
46,I have been sending crash reports for months now with no effect FF on Google pixel slate is practically unusable Unresposive and crashes after a few mins of usage This issue started on one of an upgrade months ago I tried multiple setting changes found on search with no visible changes,1
47,Whenever I am on a website and I click on the home button then I search for something it opens up a new tab Thats so SILLY whats even the purpose of having a home button And wheres the back button I prefer Firefox than Chrome but Im not going to have 10 tabs open whenever I search for something in that SAME TAB and have to swipe up and go back every single time Im going back to Chrome and I will come back in a couple of days when yall fix this is update,1
48,Well you have really ruined this browser Cant PDF a page any longer I will be tossing this away Glad I didnt update this on my other phone Why is it updates devolve something from its zenith performance and you guys call it an upgrade lol I became wise to this game a while back and if it works and i like what it does I never update anything Like the saying goes If it aint broke dont fix it Cya,1
49,Do not bother downloading the latest Firefox for Android it is beyond worthless Whoever thought that it was a good idea to completely do away with the tabs visible and on top as has been the standard in just about every web browser I have used over the last 20plus years should be immediately shown the door as this is probably the stupidest idea I have ever seen in a web browser,1
50,i just hate when i click a link for open this on the app for an app that i already have installed and it just takes me to the browser version of the google play store i will continue to use this as i will always trust Mozilla but im still incredible bitter and upset about it so i guess i had to write a lengthy review,1
51,I liked old version a lot It just worked Had i known it would disable all my addons and reset options i would not have allowed this update I increased the privacy settings to strict i am still see annoying ads and being tracked more than before Please bring back the old version until everything works again,3
52,Got a new phone and decided to finally make the switch from Chrome Phones memory seemed horrible I was constantly having to scroll back to my place in apps Id JUST been using getting worried that Id have to send the phone back Opened up developer options to see what was hogging all the RAM and it turned out Mozilla was using 13x the RAM that the OS was using Im gonna try Opera instead,1
53,The Delete Browsing Data On Quit feature no longer works on the last few updates I now have to delete cookies manually each time otherwise the site remembers me Im hesitant to update ever again  something that was working fine for me has been broken by an update I didnt really need,1
54,Pretty much the best browser you can get for Android everything else is either too controlling or limited or buggy or falls short somehow Annoying feature they just added however is that some sites like YouTube can now hide your navigation bar which is buggy and obnoxious and theres no setting to prevent them from doing that,4
55,Update 2/13/22: Better but no addons that would make it a lot more secure and the homepage silliness Slow as mud Update 11/10/21: Finally got a Home button but its not configurable to any URL Again Hello Devs: Read my lips: MAKE IT MORE LIKE THE DESKTOP VERSION Or are you assuming most AOS users are dumber than a bag of hammers Been in IT for decades and I hate the AOS versions of FF old programmer not just a Dev,2
56,Android Galaxy I am unable to do 2FA on any website because when I initiate 2FA in firefox then leave Firefox to retreive the 2FA number in either Messages mail or voice call and then go back into Firefox to enter the code the webpage auto refreshes or something and a new code is sent from the site without any imput from me This invalidates the code that I just received This doesnt happen in Chrome or on laptop Maybe result of one of my addons,1
57,Update: After a few months the developers have addressed several of the major flaws when recreating the app It is not perfect but still better now than other browser apps,3
58,I download Firefox when ever I get new device requiring browser Easy login for all my saved settings and bookmarks Lots of options for themes  colors for personalization tons of addons  such Just an overall easy to use nonmicrosoft freeware/shareware app with little to no downside Highly recommend,5
59,No option to make your bookmarks the homepage anymore It also renders text incorrectly the trademark symbol (TM) always shows up as an emoji (this doesnt happen in Chrome) and theres no option to disable emojis completely and no about:config to even LOOK for a way to turn it off,1
60,Fullscreen video leaves a blank space where the navigation bar is hidden It seems like really basic testing would have caught that Also immersive mode is terrible Change for the sake of change,2
61,I first developed the browser with Cisco and it worked Very well during my time using it with lacking sensible beneficial qualities that no longer the interest the key factors I look for in a search engine I want nothing from but was hoping to refer a few to the ones ide go with if I furthered their reasons ,3
62,For me the best Mobile and Desktop Browser User Privacy is at the heart of their business and browsing the web without being tracked should be standard by now Constant new features and upgrades make it even more reliable and fast Keep it Mozilla team ,5
63,A music app/service insessantly pushing the most idiotic podcasts each time you log in You can select which MUSICAL artists you get/dont get in your feeds but podcasts you hate have no desires to see or get reminded OUR subscriptions are paying for are in your face every time you want to explore new content Dont ever PAY a subscription because if you decide the BS is too much and you want out too bad for you the consumer,1
64,DESPERATELY NEEDS AN UPDATE Keeps crashing on load Tried uninstalling and reinstalling Lost all my bookmarks and it didnt even help Started doing it again after a few hours App is broken since latest update,1
65,I have been Mozilla user since Godzilla times if I remember that was the name of the first browser Firefox Lite is very fast and light but outdated Firefox made some improvements but used to be lighter in the past now is heavy as sniper caliber,3
66,With the last few updates I noticed that the desktop site option is not working especially on Facebook Still no option to get around the Twitter login wall when it never used to be there before,2
67,Great app I just wish there was an easy way to sign out of other devices from any other device Im fully logged into I also wish there were a way to set aside apps for later like in edge,4
68,Somehow way worse every update Most recent update the app will hide my navigation bar from me erratically Also it has a grey bar under every full screen video no matter what no way to remove it Older versions didnt have this,1
69,Ive used Firefox since the desktop version first came out and have no plans to stop Mozilla is committed to preserving my privacy unlike Google or Microsoft I have no plans to switch,5
70,so up until about 5 months ago Chrome was my main browser and I had no problems all of a sudden it would crash and they have yet to fix the problem so I started using Firefox and have had no problems and love it so far,5
71,Secure stable and reliable with lots of great plugins to help manage your privacy Also love the syncing features that allows me to view my tabs from multiple devices,5
72,i cant belive I waited so long to switch One day i was browsing on chrome and got bombarded with ads and a quick search came up with Firefox for ublock add on within 2 days Ive changed over all of my devices to Firefox and loving it,5
73,Not working properly after the latest update Very buggy Notification bar disappears and onethird of the screen is blocked by a purple bar on full screen videos,1
74,Randomly the app will make the menu buttons (back center and open apps menu) dissappear making simple navigation a nightmare Happens on mjltiple sites only on firefox unchangeable in setting Terrible bug that needs fixing asap,1
75,Not the greatest on both IOS and Android I definitely think Windows Linux and possibly Mac if you have 1920x1080 resolution Anyways Use a different browser on the phone Better alternative for windows user is Librewolf,3
76,Dont like the new upgrade at all Perhaps I should switch to Chrome I really hope Firefox doesnt do this to the PC version Also there should be a way to use the Samsung keyboard instead of gOogle,1
77,It was better getting worse I have used this for years instead of Chrome but Im having more and more issues with pages that work fine on Firefox Desktop Please fix,3
78,This browser is very up to date with the correct technologythe correct valuesthe correct understandingand the correct direction to obtain your gift so then it will easier and more cleaner to wherewhenand how to furfill your true purpose ,4
79,Garbage You cannot edit homepage shortcut names for some sites such as PBS What kind of nonsense is that Anything over Firefox 68 has this dysfunction Get it together Mozilla or get lost,1
80,Ive been using Firefox for years with great success Since recent update my fingerprint login stop working I keep getting a popup for fingerprint again but will not insert my saved passwords Guess I start using Google Chrome now,1
81,I am VERY satisfied with this app because for one even when Im downloading an app when theres no space left:  ) they will always give me options on what I MAY wish to delete Thank you Google play and have a blessed day sincerely Mrs WHEELERRICKS,5
82,Recent update introduced fullscreening without an apparent option not to and this is not something that I personally am a fan of even a tiny little bit,2
83,Edit: All this browser does now is crash constantly on my Nokia 72 ~~~~~~~~~ Give me back my extensions ENOUGH with this Collections garbage Its no wonder you guys are dramatically LOSING market share in the browser wars Do you even listen to your userbase This was once a great app Not anymore SAD,1
84,Firefox is still a very capable browser It is a good alternative to chrome and deserves more love If only to even just have and support an alternative,5
85,Simple secure and most important  doesnt consume system resources like some other browsers Go ahead when using other browsers and check your task manager to see how many instances are open when using other browsers,4
86,decent but new updates are glitchier and glitchier kinda hard to manuver between webpages when this app cant decide between full screen mode or not frustrating to use,3
87,I mostly use Firefox for its reader feature A click of a button and all the other stuff I dont care to look at is washed away for a customizable black and white screen for most webpages,2
88,Still no about:config which is the easiest to give users access to Without access to it what is Mozilla tracking that we dont want,3
89,Inferior UI and layout I only use it because it can play videos with the screen off and Mozilla is a decent company Normally 2 stars but sometimes I will rage and come here to bring down it to 1,2
90,Stupid devs had to mess up the app DONT UPDATE Browser constantly randomly hides both your status and button bars making it a pain to switch across apps Also when you go full screen on any video there is a disgusting BIG WHITE bar across that cuts the image 25%,1
91,I just switched to Firefox from Chrome due to privacy concerns Very happy so far I was able to import my Chrome bookmarks so everything is great,5
92,It works now with full desktop capability However for some reason the bank ie Bank of America says its unsupported browser So I am not sure why,3
93,In my opinion Firefox is the one and really fast and secure I use firefox on my PC and Android device both Im really thankful to its producers,5
94,Its okay it aint a Google but it still works I dont really do anything that requires privacy or anything so Im not quite for sure why anyone would get this any real other reason Also as we all well know theres nothing actually private on the internet,3
95,Inability to print from the mobile app Bookmarks do not transfer from one Android device to another The sync capability is very limited,1
96,Request: Please allow us to long press a collection title to move it up or down in the list  so we can put our collections in order The way it is now is so messy and unorganized Thank you,1
97,No issues Works as intended The best feature is the ability to use extensions just like the desktop version,5
98,Why did this app suddenly go to fulltime immersive mode It now hides my bottom system navigation bar by default which makes this browser (which i use all the time) suddenly a lot more obnoxious to use BOOO,2
99,liked it over chrome had used it before chrome became popular had used IE at work places and Firefox for personal uses after opera was sold to Chinese company after Firefox changed their engine from gecko to chrome engine i guess it is webkit it has improved a lot,4
100,Auto hides the phones navigation bar with no way to change it Having to swipe up from the bottom to get it annoys me so much Im going to use a different browser,2
101,best for yahoo mail and news ads dont lockit not great on youtube streaming so i test them all cant scroll in chromebook files and no printer support hp drivers are windows and on dvd chrome saves battery life by SSD and no dvd usb only keep up the great work,3
102,Love Firefox Long time user on my PC Firefox for Android checks all the boxes for me No need to have ChromeBig Brother Google spy on me any more than I have to,5
103,Its been over a year without printing support FIX YOUR FN APP A browser without being able to print is useless to me,1
104,Bookmarks is a mess Cant reorganize them The pinned sites is a mess too Cant reorganize them either No pull down to refresh And now Mozilla has teamed up with Facebook Big nope from me Uninstall,1
105,Why is fullscreen mode a thing I dont know how to turn it off Also translate function when (Edit: somehow turned it off messed with Samsung settings Would still like a translate function someday but that can come with time Solid browser otherwise),3
106,When I play YouTube in full screen mode there is a strange white bar at the bottom of the screen It goes away if I pull down the notification tray and push it back up again,2
107,I love all the options that come with Firefox its also a safe browser Its a bit slower than others but Worth it to have privacy,4
108,Firefox my beloved Faster than chrome and easier on my battery while respecting my privacy and user autonomy at the same time,5
109,Primitive Google page lmao No option to sign in no dark mode no options Dont have this problem in other browsers If you guys would enable AMOLED dark theme as well that would set you apart,1
110,Chrome is better than this If you are having problem with chrome Firefox also wont solve your problem,3
111,Cant search through browsing history which seems like a pretty basic function for a modern browser Seems like software engineers these days have completely abandoned common sense,2
112,The UI is good I like the color scheme its fast its not too hard on storage this is a great browser Would recommend,4
113,Thought Id give Firefox another try but I still cant pin web apps to my home screen I can pin the homepages but that is all,1
114,There is a varying degree of online security with occasional updates and necessary adjustments concerning validation A MUCH better version other than safari or mac,3
115,simply amazing how smooth the whole browser flows and ebbs working on being my only goto app from here on out Thank you for the dedication All of you thank you,5
116,Has always been my favorite browser Being able to sync my bookmarks plugins and passwordsl across my Desktop Laptop and Phone are a big help,5
117,Extension support is abismal Only 17 extensions to choose from Ive used Firefox for a long time but Im finally going to switch to Chrome,2
118,By far the best browser ever had I will grant anything just to add more security and I will love to surf for all my favorite subjects and open any links awakening switching from downloading unecesary and tidious apps that only use to much data  Thank you  Firefox Android for been so helpful and easy to use ,5
119,New version sucks i cant long press and download pictures anymore and i cant upload anything to Facebook anymore fix it or bring back the old version please Update: yes you can go to an earlier version I deleted your app and found an apk file of the latest older version i cant wait around for you guys to fix this huge mistake of yours Update: how have they still not made it possible to make your bookmarks page your homescreen Ridiculous,1
120,Mozilla is awesome Not the perfect browser for everyone but great allaround browser with some privacy on mind,4
121,WTH did you DO to this Browser Since When did it run like Molasses And have Over 280MB After clearing the Cache etc And Try to Stack up against Chrome that Only Had 7886 MB Before Clearing the Cache This App has turned into the Sorriest Female Dog of a Browser Ive EVER SEEN Good The 🤬 Bye This App 🦨 BAD You Should put your Developers in the Corner wearing a 🧑‍🤹‍🤪🦨,1
122,The best android browser REAL privacy options The best first step towards privacy Its also the fastest on my old hardware,5
123,great browser very fast just didnt need it at this time want to get it again once I get a new device thanks Don,5
124,Best free browser for phones when addons considered Most secure potentially with use of addons not available for Chrome browser on Android platform Much more secure,5
125,maximizing videos no longer work properly There is 1 cm thick bluish line And when I unmaximize the video navigation button do not show up,1
126,I started with Firefox in 1987 Somehow I lost the account and ended up at Google one day Something I never dreamed would happen happened I found myself in fb jail a 6 timer total with the last three back to back 30s Ive been aware of privacy issues for several years however I didnt know where to turn Thank you hats off to advertisers reaching me for all the RIGHT REASONS What a concept duh a browser that treats customers with good service not a hassle to use Im back,1
127,Could be great Unfortunately a huge flaw makes it painful to use The search bar with all the navigation tools hides and doesnt appear at times without backing out of the current page It might be certain content/sites settings trigger this but it is so inhibiting that it is hard to think of it as a feature Its very clunky for a mobile app If the alternatives werent so terrible Id ditch it,2
128,I love this browser and I love using it but please for the love of god let me have a dark mode I get blinded every time I open it,5
129,been the best browser since its release even though android is a google platform its always healthy to try to maintain independence from them use duckduckgo for searching,5
130,Why is it so difficult to provide the option for a user to always see the standard web page Why after having left a page set at desktop mode do I have to a retoggle it or reload the page in a new tab and then toggle it in order to get it into desktop mode Why is this so difficult And after all these months there are only 12 addons available Seriously What are you guys smoking,1
131,It works very well so do the tabs The fact it can use a few add ons is wonderful though I cant seem to mass bookmark all my tabs at once Tried selecting all and then add bookmark and while it says it work there are not anywhere to be found The only other issue is there is no easy way to save data by simply refusing to load any images sounds animations or videos If that can be done without using a addon it would be near perfect,4
132,Mobile formatting sucks Text is too small to read Firefox for Android is a failure,1
133,Not everything is loading up correctly slow at times Pages seem to be crashing often,2
134,Climate Partners came to do normal service on our furnaceCameron our tech was wonderful we had a minor problem that he repaired and cleaned up afterwards We are very pleased with them and would and have recommended them to friends and folks on Face Book Thanks,5
135,Damn good browser You can install addons to block ads and stuff on the mobile too and have an unplugged experience,5
136,Tab management is pretty annoying Whatever I do old tabs are not reused and new tabs are opened and i end up with dozens of tabs,2
137,Recently YouTube videos are Fullscreen in a smaller window size and cannot scroll through description or comment section while in landscape mode,2
138,have used Firefox for years it is a good browser with little problems,4
139,Best ever browser if you want and know you are not being tracked by Google or anything else on the web and it doesnt try to tell me my phone is infected telling me to download a virus protection app that my true security app says is not safe and then when I trust Google chrome I really do get infected by and far Mozilla is better than any Google stuff for sure,5
140,New update wont remove taskbar in full screen mode Data mining now enabled by default Mozilla Time for a change,1
141,I think its a great browser really and its really secure and stuff and its user friendly but it doesnt have much adaptability with chrome and thats important with the plugins and or extensions,4
142,Firefox remains my favorite from desktop to mobile browser can be synced between the two as well Also you can get the extensions on mobile the community input Mozilla has started surrounding their development projects like all decent open source options and innovations as well as stable choice if you use standard Firefox or beta or nightly,5
143,Everythings blocked Even Mozilla Been trying for a month to fix Ugh,1
144,One of the best Firefox option use to be Save as a PDF but its Not There Any more ,5
145,Better browser than Chrome but I wish the addon market was as populated as the desktop version,3
146,The browser is generally good and glad to have a noncheome option However the removal of choice is unfortunate Please restore about:config if you dont want to generally support customization in the menus For example I have no interest in being promoted to add a site to the home screen install an app or launch an app I do have installed I dont want a notification dont obnoxiously adorning the menu in those cases,3
147,I personally think that this browser is top shelf Finally a browser that will do what Id like it to do Rather than give me a few options that goes along with the monsters of the internet Ive replaced my chrome and Edge browsers with Firefox and I am not sorry I did There are terrific extensions and apps that a person can add to give someone even more security and privacy Than youd ever get from the monsters of the internet Great product,5
148,breaks every time I go fullscreen with a video since the last update stunned with your ability to keep making Firefox worse,1
149,Why is the back button not always visible anymore When the back button is not visible clicking the 3 dots exposes a back button that is partially visible but not clickable,1
150,Very good Lets me use adblock so its infinitely better than chrome Just wish I could have separate groups of tabs,4
151,I like that it has extensions and that it is not run by Google Facebook Apple Amazon or Microsoft However not having site pinning is inexcusable and is the exact same type of behavior that those tech monopolies display every single day Allow me to choose what content I get pushed to me do not use algorithms and addictive garbage to push sites When you display this behavior you are equally as evil as those aforementioned companies What Im asking for is simple,1
152,I had to finally just move on from Firefox to DuckDuckGo I dont understand why Firefox needs to tell me how I like things You used to be able to save as pdf reorder tabs it would default open to the last page you used those are great features If I have 50 tabs open its because I want 50 tabs open no I dont need you to make them inactive or auto close them but at least you can turn those features off,1
153,Edit: things have improved but Im only giving 3 because its very concerning how long it took I love Firefox and Mozilla but this app is basically unusable for me after the latest update Pages will often get stuck in loading forever or load improperly while my other browsers work perfectly fine I was trying to be patient they made a mistake and theyll surely fix it but its been over a month now Im going to try a different default browser for a bit and check back in another month,3
154,012022 another update STILL NO PRINT Ill take that as a SCREW YOU from developers Long time user on several platforms For some odd reason print function was removed from this Android version some time ago It STILL has not been put back in Why and Why What a really bad call on someone Such a highly functional feature for so many gone and probably me too Didnt care much for this new version anyway,1
155,Very problematic browser: 1FREQUENTLY locks up and says Connection is not secure  It will not allow you to bypass that warning or navigate to the sites that you know to be safe Even about:config produces the same message 2 Saves search history but does not allow searching the history 3 Allows you to visit the Google page but does not allow you to type into the Google search field God bless the developers for trying but why keep wasting time with these issues,1
156,do not EVER update: they make noxious changes that destroy existing functionality UPDATE 1/30/2002 Latest release ELIMINATED HOME PAGES Ive been using browsers since the beginning  NCSA Mosaic  the first release of Netscape  and the home page has been a feature of every browser since The colossal arrogance of Mozzilla in dropping a MAJOR feature of every browser for the past 30 years I have the APK for Firefox 68  fortunately it still installs  works Find it  downgrade,1
157,New version cannot import/export bookmarks Duh Why would they get rid of this If it aint broke dont fix it,1
158,Update doesnt happen automatically Links that start as insecure are blocked without resolution,1
159,I like that this browser doesnt try to hijack your phone and wont start acquiring all of your personal data all of your contact info etc Its very clean clear  has precision Its not a power hog it doesnt consume all my bandwidth  I can integrate it as much or as little as I want between devices location and even over time Lastly you can tell that its not cluttered with a few million lines of code,5
160,Loved the old Firefox and continually used it by not allowing the phone to update to this new version I just couldnt get used to this new disaster Since I just updated to a new phone I decided to give it a try again Its working better but not where it needs to be Its definitely not the Firefox that we all loved If you guys can make only one improvement please make the Desktop site feature to be remembered as its a PITA to continually having to every time I leave and reenter the app,1
161,Clunky hard to use even harder to type on I am disappointed because I love Firefox otherwise To be specific the address bar is at the bottom of the screen and I am somehow supposed to swipe down (as in towards the bottom of the page which could be very long) to refresh a page instead of up like literally every other browser Bookmarks are difficult to access and typing is just Weird It seems the browser cant keep up with my fingers and skips whole words,2
162,Ive been a tech for over 30 years I only recommend Firefox to all my clients/friends a VPN greatly improve your protection,5
163,Excellent until recently  Recently this browser has stopped working with lots of the forms that get filled out online The keyboard is opening up over the forms and you cant move the forms so that you can see the sections you need while youre filling them out Also the submit buttons are often not accessible on the screen at all It used to work fine but now its problematic,2
164,I started using Firefox for PC in 2004 I was excited when I discovered Firefox was available for my Android phone Now its been over a year since you removed the Save as pdf feature Apparently its not coming back I can not imagine why it was ever removed You are heading in the wrong direction Im going to Opera it has the features I need Goodbye Firefox we had a good run ,1
165,Update: Thank you After over a year they finally brought back the ability to watch 2+ YT videos at once w/ different volume levels Tyvm for bringing that function back Now if you could also revert to being able to enter different tabs without having to do the extra twotaps because the app makes you look at the browser home screen before entering an old tab since the November update Once that is fixed this will be the best browser app by far Thank you again for the YT fix I mentioned before,5
166,Well they finally did it Firefox on windows is now broken Since I can no longer use the sync functionality I have no reason to continue using this app,1
167,App lacks basic functionality cannot print to PDF Developers solution with instructions on how to take a screenshot is RIDICULOUS Also used to be able to move tabs around and organize Cant now You can select them To delete them App has been hobbled and is not the Firefox Ive gotten used to using So unimpressed with this app since they fired all the devs that could and kept the ones that cant Next browser Taking suggestions,1
168,I use Firefox on my Computer and on my phone This browser is the most convenient and efficient out of all the others Plus I can open tabs on my computer and then access them on my phone cause its all set synced The QR scanner is also very handy when you open a new tab Overall its just a great browser,5
169,Great browser Safe Need to add ability to sync collections Edit: this browser has become my go to browser Unlike other browsers it isnt intrusive It protects from pishing tracking from sites My searches are utilized as ads by google (Adblock is a friend which is an addon that this browser supports) Need more addons for mobile phone  tablet though most of us dont carry our laptops with us Do it firefox You added the ability to sync our collections Thank you,5
170,Only nonprofitbacked browser with ad blocker that is secure private  fast Go bold with more control of your internet experience than ever before Now you can see your open tabs recent searches and favorite sites all in one place The new Firefox home screen adapts to you The more you use it the smarter it gets Firefox makes it easier for you to pick up right where you left off When it comes to your life online you have a choice: accept the factory settings or put your privacy first,5
171,Seems like turtle spam I would not play with this if my solar involved They are so janky and Christy I will never recommend anyone to this¡¡¡¡¡,1
172,Ive been using Firefox for many years on Android Linux and windows the sync function for favorites is a life saver for someone who needs to go back and read something Its also useful for paying bills saving login credentials Google has been breached and hotmail (now known as Outlook has been breached) Firefox has never been in a public breach scandal unlike my other accounts its a reliable safe browser a credit to the browser world,5
173,Overall I love using Firefox over all other search engines The only issue however is when I installed a Google Play app I was under the impression the app was free and once I installed the app it said thank you for your purchase so I think with that being it shouldnt say thank you for your purchase but instead say thank you your app has been installed successfully This has happened to me on other platforms I just chose to reported it her to F/F first They say if it aint broke dont fix it,4
174,I love having on using my tablet Especially when Im at Starbucks where Im particularly obnoxious about letting everyone know that I use Firefox which makes me feel superior to those using chrome,5
175,Its ridiculous how much worse this app has gotten The UX has been completely redone for the worse pages cant be saved offline 99% of extensions obliterated and Mozilla could not care less Oh and basically all config options have been ripped away as well Firefox 3+ years ago was a good browser so just stick with those old versions or find another browser Its not worth putting up with a company that cares this little about its users,1
176,My old review was deleted somehow App has many problems properly displaying popular websites that otherwise work fine in all other browsers  It is painfully slow Tried everything ie reinstall addons delete history cookies etc etc etc Been using for decades Using alternatives now,2
177,I had googled for the new firefox but thus far Im happy with it I use to be a big fan of DuckDuckGo but since Ive used this APP  easy to use and less clutter It seems to load fine as Im referring to the search engine I like the WAY I can go back during emails and click on another link without interruption Thus far  most definitely five stars I would recommend it to friends/acquaintances Thank you and hope others will try this APP,5
178,This is my favorite browser It takes a bit of getting used to but what it (very slightly) lacks in intuitiveness it makes up tenfold in ability Id love to see more extentions compatible with android but being thirdparty made means theres not much Firefox could do about that still the laymen essentials (adblockers and a variety of privacy protectors mostly) are still available so it isnt a huge inconvenience for me :],4
179,Garbage whats that suggested logins thing at the bottom that includes advertising I want my older version back Firefox is NOT the browser it once was Its bloated ad infested Google tracked garbage now You destroyed Firefox when it was overhauled to stop certain extensions like NoScript from functioning the way it had been And kept on changing it So much has changed on the net Browsers no longer protect users now protect web business and content providers,1
180,best browser ever cant say enough try u see it for yourself trusted reliable secure just to mention the few,5
181,Dec 2021  Installed Firefox yesterday on a brand new Samsung tablet Firefox worked fine the first day An hour ago the threedot toolbar menu froze and is no longer responsive to touch Via the tablets app settings Ive cleared the cache and also rebooted the tablet The threedot menu remains frozen with two of the dots slightly grayed out Any suggestions Thanks,1
182,a couple of year ago I downloaded Firefox and needless to sayjust never took the time to see all of its qualitiesgot aggrevated and deleted the app well after a brief absence a friend encouraged me to try it again After redoing it these last couple months im happy to announce that this is one of the simplest apps Ive ever encountered I trust you folks will keep it coming so from the great state of Oklahoma Id like to say Merry Christmas to each one of youins and a Blessed New Year,5
183,I have been using Firefox as my primary browser for over 15 years Recently it has been going downhill very fast There are glitches and bugs in the Android version that have not been fixed for months to years Shame on the development team for such incompetence I am forced to use another browser now because I am just fed up with dealing with the same problems the devs seemingly cannot fix,2
184,This app is a buggy mess I have to constantly force close and restart There is a new bug that triggers a new window when selecting a recently viewed site from the home screen Selecting one of those links also opens the keyboard I just disabled those links and now type in links by hand also Firefox no longer respects system light/dark modes When system is in dark mode settings are unusable I dont like Firefox but choose it over GC because it respects my PiHole,1
185,Firefox was my goto web browser on my laptop for years until Chrome became the standard end all be all browser for MSoft users I love that I could move the search bar to the bottom of the screen I love the neat tidy streamlined default page w/ tailored news recommendations I love how easy  intuitive it is to navigate  operate Basically I just love it🦊,5
186,The more I use this new version more I hate it I have been forced to use other browsers more To many complaints to list It has been over a year with little improvement Use Firefox beta if you want to access about:config You can Google 68110enUSandroidx8664apk for the older version Be sure to get it from the mozilla site,1
187,Its okay My whole reason for wanting to use firefox on phone  tablet is to access and save bookmarks across devices I have a lot of bookmarks and bookmark folders and when saving a bookmark into a folder this app shows the entire bookmark toolbar tree exploded making it very tedious to scroll down to find the desired target directory in which to save the bookmark So I end up emailing links to myself and save the bookmark later when sitting at my desktop pc,3
188,I like it for the most part Its fast I like the layout I like the collections Using menus on sites is hit or miss however This is a big inconvenience to have to switch to another browser and see if they work there Some drop down menus for example dont work in Firefox but if I switch the edge or opera they work fine,4
189,Useless options freedoms removed I use this while away from my wifi where I have to pay for data and I have yet to find a single webpage where videos respect my autoplay setting They always play and always eat up data This used to be an easy fix yourself in about:config but they took that away maybe a year ago Less transparency should always be a red flag,1
190,More bugs after recent update/last review: 1 FF cant go anywhere on internet Gives message that connection is not secure (and wont go to site) despite having not changed any settings and/or disabling native adblock/privacy apps 2 No option to disable AutoPlay videos on Youtube Its tiresome  annoying having to hit Pause button EVERYTIME  on EVERY videos  when browsing through video chanels or to read comments on any chanel If you like fix it If you dont then dont,1
191,Firefox has helped this longtime user a great deal with the Inactive Tabs feature I am a tab hoarder and Firefox has for its 20some years history ALWAYS been the best at tabs Now the browser helps me nondestructively declutter This is honestly a very user friendly choice Thank you Tabs are among the most important application features of Firefox Its often been the innovator in interface design especially in navigation tabs I hope that continues,5
192,The last decent iteration of this browser is version 68101 The new features included honestly make using this browse a hassel most of the time I dont want a new tab to open every time I select a shortcut in the home page I dont want private mode to function as a toggle I dont want to open the settings section to refresh pages or halt them from loading Links are also harder to accurately select than they use to be Too much clutter and limits the usability the browser used to have,2
193,I am part of the group experiencing the gray bar on YouTube full screen and missing menu buttons Please revert whatever changes brought this upon us,3
194,Mozilla constantly updates this browser With (almost) every update they replace my homepage or change my settings My full time job is not as a beta tester for Mozilla Crawling back to opera to apologize now,1
195,The newest thing that does not work with Android Firefox: does not connect to Facebook probably due to weaker tls certs facebook uses Error: Secure Connection Failed The page you are trying to view cannot be shown because the authenticity of the received data could not be verified Please contact the website owners to inform them of this problem All instructions how to bypass this block are geared towards Firefox on PC not Android No FF for Android does not have about:configetc,1
196,Once I install Firefox in my Samsung A12 I couldnt see the app icon in the home screen I was opening from Google play and I thought there was something wrong with it Heres how I got it  1 Tap settings 2 Home screen 3 Turn on Add new apps to home screen  and thats nothing wrong now I open it from home screen,1
197,Ive been having problems with my tabs for a while now When I close the app 90% of the time the most recent tabs that Ive either opened or closed do not save  meaning the tabs I open are not there anymore when I open Firefox again whereas the tabs Ive closed reopen by themselves Firefox is my main browser on my phone so Im hoping this problem can be fixed so I can use the app more reliably Sometimes when I go back to a tab I was on it wont load and Ill have to close it to reopen,2
198,Theres no way to change tab settings beyond turning off the inactive tabs feature When I type something in the URL bar of an existing tab clicking enter opens a new tab I did not ask for When I click on a tab to load it Im met with a jump back in landing page instead of the tab loading correctly Sure hope these are bugs that Mozilla plans to fix soon because if theyre features Ill switch to a browser that isnt broken,1
199,My current favorite  most useful browser So much more Versatile than Chrome in terms of attachments plugins Hand ability to identify and download Photos and videos I keep finding myself coming to Firefox for All the things that Chrome cannot do Please never change this browser or Limit its capabilities This is one of the Last remaining browsers from the good old Days of the free/open Web,5
200,Still the worst Upgrade of any browser There used to be a number of really useful add ons to the old Firefox Now there are only 16 Why is no one making more add ons for Firefox Because this is a browser platform that just keeps getting worse and worse with each iteration Start making backwards compatible add ons and/or allow xpi extensions to work with Firefox for Android,1
201,Maybe im overthinking perfection doing 4 indtead of 5 stars but despite tiny silly things ive been able to rely on firefox over the years Its sensible keeps improving and doesnt overload my computer with unnecessary processing (that is the computer version) I was right to immediately select firefox over chrome when i started to use a smart phone Thank you firefox,4
202,i have always loved firefox and the mozilla browser since day 1 and the mobile app is quality as always its just superior to all the others especially the native browsers on cell phones lol firefox is great particularly because of the EXTENSIONS an adblocker will *save your life* if you ever watch youtube on your phone trust me youll never go back,5
203,This browser works really well I wish I could search trough my bookmarks,5
204,Addons are not working properly Specifically Ublock Origin and others Please fix,1
205,Last update is a mess and theres no choice to go back to the version that works Gotta go browser shopping Sad They had a good thing going for them and seriously messed it up,1
206,Since 2008 Ive been using Firefox with satisfaction The browser application for Android OS is easily configured with many addons and selectable preferences allowing a user to work/search with less distractions and higher productivity Over the years Ive used many browsers from Microsoft Google and Opera along with others I believe Mozilla has developed this iteration of Firefox and it has become a very well suited browser platform for my complicated and convoluted ways Best Regards LH,5
207,I have used Firefox since my first android and before but it has just gotten horrible over the last couple of years There is no about:config and you can no longer disable open recent tabs that I know of Constant google recaptcha popups I basically dont even use Firefox anymore Its barely usable,1
208,Firefox combined with Googles Gboard keyboard (v7a releases only) and Lonely Cats Xplore file manager are the ultimate copy  paste tools to use on (or off) the web for NVIDIA Shield devices AWESOME,5
209,Two stars for the address bar on the bottom but thats it This update disabled 2/3 of the add ons I was using like user agent switcher I have to go back to using Chrome until this is fixed Edit: They added back the user agent switcher addon so I bumped up to 3 stars Still missing others,3
210,Still lousy experience on a Chromebook Screen constantly goes black when you pause scrolling making it all but unusable,1
211,Fast private and efficient My choice for the full suite of products,5
212,A real browser with real extensions (eg UBlock Origin) Highly recommended on android,5
213,1) Current update crashes CONSTANTLY with multiple tabs open 2) Issues with freezing in full screen mode 3) For the love of god please fix your bookmarks system Having to manually edit bookmarks 1 at a time for them to go into a folder makes this the least functional bookmark system of any browser Also Multiple bookmarking at once and/or bookmark movement would be nice Inactive tabs was a nice addition but not if I cant keep tabs open for more than 30 minutes without FF crashing,1
214,I really liked Netscape and when it went away there was Firefox Firefox has been my default browser for a long time now and I think it will stay that way I am amazed at the variety and creativity that Firefox always displays All of my friends and family hear nothing but positive reasons for why I use Firefox,5
215,The Android version of Mozilla Firefox is a much more slimed down version of the PC version in Windows 10 I can transfer import passwords bookmarks ect without logging into an account via sync There exists no option in the settings or customize sections in the 3 dot menu to perform this task The developers of this app might want to encode this feature in the Android version to make it easier to perform this process,2
216,So far i keep finding myself having to double tap really hard to back out any page Noticing i cant clear my searching via Bing unless i refresh Uninstalling I have now uninstalled the app Firefox seems overrated I shouldnt have to tap multipule times just to get out of a bing page Too frustrating,2
217,I really like that instead of opening duplicate tabs of the same URL it switches to the existing tab At least this is the case when opening links from other apps and FF is set as the default browser Would be nice if Bookmarks could be exported to HTML Share all tabs fails with large number of tabs Does not seem to support Android system Autofill service,3
218,Honestly I am not so fanatically enthusiastic about Firefox and would prefer not to give it five stars since I have my criticisms of the browser but I have no better alternatives available Firefox is superior to Google Chrome and Microsoft abandoned development of independent webbrowser (the new MS Edge is UI shell for Chrome source code) There are few minor browsers out there (such as Opera) but those all include the hassle of compatibility ie pages frequently do not properly load,3
219,Starred using this bc WebView apps non stop crashing I heard this doesnt use that Firefox doesnt seem to have the same crashee as the WebView base apps This app is great other than a werid glitch where taps are off when auto hide url bar is on If you tap the screen and the taps are clicking things above your tap you have to turn auto hide url bar off,4
220,Its back to the future with this classic browser evolved from the original Mozilla / Netscape builds As an IT architect with seems a lifetime of faith in Chrome sadly it is no longer an option As it is built on Chrome I migrated to Brave user for privacy However their builds take longer to integrate the ever increasing Chrome security vulnerabilities that are exposed Faster and more secure and Firefox has proudly reclaimed its aforementioned legacy,5
221,This app has worked awesome w no issues for years but all the sudden in last 2 wks its turned to junk I cant attempt to search or even close out all the open tabs It crashes w in minutes of trying to use or close tabs Guess i am uninstalling and finding an alternative Sucks cause i have been a mozilla fan for years and years,1
222,Not the same Firefox Im used to I really dont care for the tabs and homepage new behaviors with no way to change it Even all the addon that helped make it user friendly are gone And it displays text on top of text Uninstalling,1
223,Unable to access stored cookies Edit: You updated You provide more clutter to the homepage and a wheres waldo game of figuring out how to clean the garbage out But unless youve decided to make it hidden too we still cant access stored cookies Funny everyone else seems to permit that,1
224,Major redesign update created a few problems Main: it is now much much slower pages taking tens of seconds to load on fast connections Same on desktop via the network connection loads the same resource in fraction of a second Tabs listing page was better before the update: tiles gave quicker tab recognition and more intuitive Row listing is slower and harder to use Should seriously consider reverting the update until better fix It was really good before  risking mass alienation otherwise,2
225,Removing features I dont use is not a big concern Removing the ability to print to my HP printer is a showstopper Exporting bookmarks to Brave uninstalling What in the world are you doing devs,1
226,the best browser no tracking lots of features and no prying eyes,5
227,I really want to like firefox on my android because I use it on desktop However the mobile app is such a sad shell of the desktop version,2
228,This new version is clumsy and odd lost its natural feel if I can find a way to reinstall the old version I will The reviews I see here are for firefox in general and as a long time user I agree however my review is for the latest update as of 1/20/22,3
229,Fast and safe browser With a Samsung S20 FE5G using Android 12 it really runs quite well I have most of the popular ad blockers and such and I flares it flies Some sites like Instagram wont run well or at all because of not being able to track me Screw them and the horse they rode in on is my motto with big tech my privacy is mine and Ill not be spied on or my data şolđ or given to other nefarious and official entities when studying ×eapons and ×unsm×thing Ssuusshh dont tell lolol,4
230,Im not sure what the developers are doing but it seems Firefox is removing websites that are bookmarked by the user Plenty of websites I visit have all of a sudden been removed even after I save them Unless this is a form of controlling what people view please fix this issue Theyve removed my post 8 times,1
231,Great browser but missing a few key features HUGE NEED for a feedback/report feature Lots of websites dont load properly recurring theme around websites that have an agree to cookies popup that might not be visible It grays out the whole screen until you agree to cookies but if its offscreen there is no way to agree Ive bumped into this 5+ times Also cant duplicate a tab Come on thats a pretty basic feature,3
232,Cant turn off the location access to phone access to Contacts etc without getting repeated notices to turn them back on Even with Google Notifications turned off i want to turn it on only when needed to search and obtain an App,1
233,Does perfectly what a browser is supposed to do Stay out of my business stay out of my way Its access to the web without the gatekeeper,5
234,Thank you thank you thank you I could not figure out how to turn off autocomplete/ trending searches using the standard google search widget so I was constantly bombarded with nonsense search suggestions This app has eliminated that and so much more with the collections jump back in etc features Thank you,5
235,Best browser ever period Been using Firefox since my first PC in 2004 The sync across devices is amazing and helps with my IT career since I have a 2FA secured app to keep passwords Ditch any other browser Chrome is meh If you want an Outlook alternative try Mozilla Thunderbird Its simple and just works like Firefox does ,5
236,Ive always been an avid Firefox user and am glad to have the mobile version on Android However I do find it inconvenient that there are no methods to adjust some of the interface and moving some of the hidden hamburger menu buttons to a second toolbar on my screen,3
237,The browser works great but I ran into a problem when I was using desktop mode on YouTube where it would shove the video down making me unable to see the actual video I had to Uninstall and reinstall the app to fix it,3
238,Firefox is still my preferred browser but recent updates are frustrating I do not like that new tabs open automatically whether entering a URL or using bookmark Doesnt stay in the same tab I am already in After surfing end up with 10+ tabs open And nothing in Settings to stop this behavior,2
239,Firefox cant upload photos to facebook has no easy way to block popups support sucks basically there is no support People either never get firefox issues resolved  or the way to do something is extremely time consuming and overly complicated,1
240,The fact that I cant access about:config to change where my files download to is ridiculous If they dont trust users to be able to successfully navigate the about:config without breaking the browser they should add the ability to change the download location to the settings menu,2
241,I have finally abandoned Firefox after they screwed up WebGL in Ubuntu and couldnt log into a website to do my work,1
242,I have been personally using Firefox since it was released in 2004 It has NEVER glitched on me had issues with any sites I opened (helloooo Chrome ) and has done a great job blocking or warning me about bad links etc I highly recommend it especially to work places stuck on Chrome,5
243,seriously whats not to love about Firefox granted it doesnt have all the plugins it used to but it still has enough stopping power for bad stuff is it possible to have malware etc creep in yes but thats any browser And ff is far better for you than chrome or edge Adopt ff pls For your own privacy,2
244,I like your browser and that its secure but I cant organize my bookmarks like you can in Chrome Id also like to be able to see and delete individual cookies so the ones I want kept wont have to be deleted,4
245,Using this instead of Focus because it offers adons and better tab support Nice alternative to Chrome Update to newest version caused the loss of all of my saved logins Missing print page option Add to Home screen missing for some sites Has begun to restart itself in the background like a system app,2
246,Updated and it crashes all the time The old version I had was rock solid Why did you even put this out I seriously might move to Chrome on my phone and odds are itll push me on Desktop too for synch Frustrating as an original Phoenix user,1
247,Great app use it on all of my devices But with my new job I need to print a lot of information and this basic feature is still removed from the latest Firefox Please bring this back Ive never used a web browser that does not allow you to print it seems pretty silly,4
248,Honestly really wanted to use this over chrome or edge as I just dont trust those companies But Firefox if you want ppl to use your browser make it functionally useful We cant even copy a URL anymore Thats like basic 101 level functionality Cmon man,3
249,It would be nice if the tabs closed upon quitting as theyre supposed to instead of me manually having to close them two days later,3
250,So easy to use When something not just easy to understand but doing its job its very irritating as a consumer to find out that almost every year upgrades are made and I have to learn new things As far as Im concerned if something isnt pro dont fix it As a gay man I would rather have sex with a woman and ever do Google Chrome again in my life Its horrible and its hard to find the bookmarks,2
251,it has some glitchs that really do need to be fixed but I like more than chrome,3
252,The recent update is causing loading issues When it starts it just hangs and doesnt try to load any webpage It will eventually work after forcing stop multiple times but it is hit or miss when it will work,2
253,Keeps getting better and better with each update my favourite part of this app has to be that you are able to decide whether or not you want the toolbar on the top or thebottom Main reason I left chrome to begin with Great job guys,5
254,I hate it when my page turns sideways and I see no OBVIOUS WAY to turn it verticalyou guys need to get your act together so we older men can use your productI am 76 and suddenly my screen turns horizontal and there is not a button to press that will turn it right side up Or is there Am I wrong,1
255,Firefox for me is perfect for reading And with so many great plugins and themes you can find something to fit your persona and make the ego happy I mean isnt life all about letting the ego play until its tuckered out Fun stuff,5
256,Not so Private Too many things recorded that the user did not ask for Can not type a simple url everything is searched tru default seach engine  Feels like a search engine vs a browser It should set default settings to more private No gain on privacy vs chrome unless u know ur game in settings and how the big tech sneakiness work in general,1
257,There was a update that changed tab functionality so that now when I go to a new URL it opens a new tab rather than just navigating to the new URL So I end up with 20 new tabs by the end of the day which take forever to close I have no idea how to go back to the old functionality if its even possible,1
258,Constantly having webpages that refuse to load unless i use a different browser then theres no issue,1
259,Give us a way to export bookmarks to an HTML file like we can with the desktop version All reasonable people agree that this is a crucial aspect of backing up data The synch feature is not a backup method If you cant hold files in your hand you dont have a backup,4
260,Removing the option to choose my own home page is NOT more personalized wt All of the other junk on that list was already in the options  options *I* shut off and DID NOT WANT Forcing us to use your tracking site as a home page is doubleplusungood,1
261,This new update auto hides your android status bar and navigation keys with no way to disable it Totally ruins switching tabs and apps,1
262,Frustrating layout Can there be a classic Firefox without account synching and credit card saving and automatically signing me into a google account and it look like pre2019 Firefox Download is broken tab organization is broken read mode is broken,1
263,Their last 2 updates have caused a condition where simple web pages take 2 + minutes to load I regret dismissing comments here mentioning the same This has caused firefox to be completely unusable How can they introduce such a change that for all intents and purposes breaks the application,1
264,Used it a lot was preferred But just cant go on without FileSave Page As or FilePrint (Android) These are just so useful Ill have to switch to another browser Sorry Mozilla you were pretty good but cant take away important functions,3
265,Youre too Intrusive This is my tablet Not my phoneIm spending 15 minutes just to check my news  mail You havent checked your space for 27 days Lie  Scan needed  Too hot ANNOYINGClean your phone now,1
266,Out of all the internet browsing apps Firefox is hands down the best one love the tracker blocking protection they offer and the application itself is so smooth and streamline The options for addons is also a huge plus you have a completely customizable browsing experience based on your personal preferences Keep slayin it Mozzila,5
267,Theyve improved things a bit but the way bookmarks are managed is awful They need to add the ability to easily move bookmarks into folders How is this simple feature not part of their browser It would take a day to code it,3
268,I am still waiting for this app to show me how its so much better than other browsers is it user friendly no step by step helping me use it no connecting my devices together easily no The Google app store was the best place to find apps and now most of their apps have problems Big time,2
269,This browser has been recommend by more than one friend After downloading it I see why Thank you Mozilla/Firefox for providing a safe and secure browser and for keeping the email addresses safe and secure as well,5
270,A truly beautiful browser With Windows integration awesome One sugestión* is when youre using the same key board layout let it recognize which language were trying to type in En conclusión its the ideal browser for any age student corporate office etc More Bing/Bing rebate integration would be nice,5
271,Still pretty good app I liked it better when it first came out I was able to surf the whole web now I only receive selected online stores in my searches I am pretty sure there are more than eight companies selling products,4
272,I love the way firefox is so customisable Nobody is perfect or Id give it 5 stars UPDATE: The one thing that I dont understand about Firefox is why you have to go into the three dotes and set the desktop setting each  every time Cant it be set once and let it be,4
273,I feel much safer using a browser from Mozilla rather than one from a forprofit tech company By using Firefox I have greater confidence that my personal information is safe My only complaint is that there are a few minor bugs in Firefox mobile that arent present in the desktop version,4
274,Keeps crashing First it started w/multiple tabs open but now its doing it even in a single tab Have easily submitted 50 crash reports in the past 7 days A few months ago the app was completely stableneed to consider a rollback ETA 1/21/22: FFS fix it already,1
275,Ill always prefer Firefox over Chrome It runs more efficiently using less memory It looks clean and feels secure And all your browser info can be synced between devices just like Chrome ( Plus the options for browser extensions are way better like uBlockOrigin ),5
276,The navigation bar gives automatically and I cant hit back after latest update,4
277,I like Firefox but Im upset that on my new tablet the Android Firefox doesnt support most addons It only supports the most popular like 20 addons Which does not include the ones I use and need most These same addons worked fine on my old Android tablet Firefox,3
278,In catering to all the people who leave tabs open for a month (they cant tell the difference between a bookmark and a tab) youve broken tabs for normal users WHY would you unload a tab that isnt being viewed for mere seconds then reload when switching back to it Can we not hit refresh ourselves if needed Some pages scroll endlessly (loading more content as you scroll) and refreshing one of these pages against your will after scrolling for an hour all because you tabbed is a nightmare,1
279,Firefox has been my primary browser for years on every platform  Android Windows Mac OS and Linux Its more stable than Chrome or at least I get significantly fewer support calls for problems involving Firefox than for Chrome Edge or Safari,5
280,The priority should be revising the recent bookmarks on homepage this is not good as is Let me show all bookmarks or select which bookmarks are on homepage This browser handles most of my complaints about DDG so well done,3
281,I exclusively use Firefox on both desktop and mobile IMO it has more customization options than Chrome AND its significantly more private AND faster (for me) I also dont like that Google is becoming a monopoly Mozilla is far more transparent with their data practices,3
282,Update Review: Firefox has improved since my last review The not so obvious features I mentioned in my earlier review are now obvious Perhaps I can find a ways to customize more in my toolbar This browser is also more stable than some others I tried,4
283,I really like Firefox on my laptop/desktop and on my phone However the lack of keyboard shortcuts makes it intollerable for use on my tablet Wish I could rate it higher,3
284,Best browser Ive ever used I love the ability to have my browsing history automatically erased when I close the browser Protects my privacy and doesnt spy on me like all things Google,5
285,For the most part I like it Im glad they fixed viewsource But It is very anoying that in history some sites are in groups and I cant fix it I just want my history to be normal and not have to go inside folders to see all my history,3
286,Recent versions have made previously visited URLs harder to find in the address bar Limited selection of addons even though other builds show they work No about:config support Optout telemetry,3
287,I removed the Twitter app and logged in through the Firefox browser because they updated the app and it is worthless now My words get all jumbled up and browser bogs down while Im trying to tweet through the mobile browser Especially if i am trying to rephrase what I wrote by making edits before I submit Its really frustrating,1
288,I installed Firefox on my Galaxy S20 to get away from Google So what happened Every time I browse in Firefox I get a google verification window that makes me select traffic lights motorcycles or chimneys or some other nonsense to show Im a person I hate google  all the tracking of personal information they do  I don’t want them on my phone AT ALL If Firefox does not reply and get rid of google Ill remove Firefox  google for DuckDuckGo  they both can loose my data Fix this or lose me,1
289,Im only using it because I have Firefox on the computer but its biggest flaw and it is a really big flaw and I dont understand how it still exists is that it doesnt show download progress If it didnt have my saved passwords in it I would probably be using Chrome or basically anything else,2
290,This was the best browser on Android untill they ruined it completely with the new redesign theres barely any addons anymore no themes frequent crashes when trying to save images doesnt let me take scrolling screenshots on my Redmi 10 (Opera works with this),2
291,Switching tabs is a PITA Im used to love firefox no so much anymore I wish I could turn back the clock to a couple of prior versions I literally cant use FF anymore,1
292,they still havent added printing back I know the old hap has it on my old phone Ive used Firefox for a long time but Im starting to doubt the app No printing plus the constant changes of how the app works,2
293,Amazing added everything useful Chrome had had that they were missing like sliding on the address bar to change tabs and many useful details missing in Chrome Default mobile browser for the first time,5
294,One suggestion for five stars: please add a Copy URL link to the three dot menu This is one of the most common things that anyone does on a phone browser and its a cumbersome process in Firefox Otherwise great,4
295,Google went loco on me for awhile Glad Firefox was there I was suprised that in the two years since I switched there have only been maybe two websites that didnt work with it,1
296,Dependable goes where your interest is and doesnt put a gazillion ads in your face based on your activities I love FIREFOX  have been using it for years I will continue to make it my default browser Thanks Firefox Team,5
297,After the latest update Firefox crashes while loading basically any web site Cleared the cache disabled all addons and nothing changed Its become totally useless EDIT: Seems to be back to its normal noncrashy self Thanks,1
298,Unable to disable the pop up blocker While useful there are times when it is needed but there is no way to disable it and Firefox support doesnt respond to requests for help in regards to this problem,2
299,fast easy to use and has dark mode as an immediate option also Firefox doesnt track you like some big g companies do never has any issue logging in or running other sites and has a really nice interface,4
300,While it is wonderful to be able to have Firefox on my chromebook it doesnt have standard desktop features Cant set home page cant choose to use desktop page as default Very frustrating,2
301,Love this browser but its not as smooth and fast on my phone I wish it was optimized to be fast and smooth I love that there are addons like privacy addons and much more one of the best part of Firefox I think this browser need optimization to smooth Hopefully the next updates makes it smooth and fast,3
302,Slow and customization has been effectively neutered from this app Firefox is also now partnering with Facebook so it looks like Firefox now has no reason to be used by anyone,1
303,Firefox has been my preferred browser for a few years now One of the ways this app shines is that it allows extensions so I can block ads on my phone Thank you so much for the hard work you put in to keep Firefox alive,5
304,They removed a number of extensions I rely on for safe browsing This update should not have been released without full extension support Also cannot print web pages or save to pdf from the app,1
305,They released a new update about a year ago where they managed to kill off almost all addon support and whittle it down to a tiny preapproved list Pretty embarrassing someone at Mozilla thought that would be a good idea,1
306,Safe secure fast intuitive The current iteration of Firefox on Android is the best its ever been and with a few add ons can protect against most of the unwanted stuff out there Go Mozilla we need you now more than ever,5
307,I overall prefer this browser to Chrome but any sort of Google traffic seems to be throttled on this browser Even opening links from a Google search can take 10 seconds or longer,3
308,The new update sucks changed my search engine wiped out my recent pages defaulted to bottom url bar Why Updated to 1 star The tabs should close when I hit the back button Lingering grand is irritating,1
309,Pretty much just Firefoxs desktop browser but just on mobile Great that I can use my favorite addons on the mobile browser as well such as ublock or dark reader very seldom issues like with Jackboxtv often works beautifully and quickly,4
310,Firefox behaves like a very wise General a 5 Star General The Desert Fox Gets in and out with Superior Strategical Grace Information can be saved or COOKIES can be Scortured and turned to dust Disappear like a footprint in the sand,5
311,Firefox is a breath of fresh air with outstanding features and everything within reach as it should be It really is a great help and a pleasure to use Ps Thank you for recently adding the ability to open at the homescreen,5
312,Works and I get to keep 15 years of bookmarks The opening page has become obtrusive and cumbersome Yes I know how to fix it but nearly every update I have to fix it again This is a pain,2
313,Last few updates make it more and more  not easy to use Change apps go back and  window closes Change tabs and go back has to reload If poor/no connection tab data gone The new home is awful,1
314,Love the add on feature for AdBlock etc which is why I switched to Firefox More customization under settings would be nice For example choosing where our downloads are saved Instead of the default path Thanks,4
315,Firefox is my favorite browser on any platform Software freedom personal privacy and plenty of great innovative features The developers really care about the project,5
316,A musthave The inclusion of addons and playing music/videos while minimized is life changing lol It also seems more lightweight than Chrome for Android Suck it google,4
317,Privacy concerns Be sure to turn off data collection to their data collection vendor I had already set up my security settings to clear my cache and history on quit but it reset after an update and I wasnt informed,2
318,They obviously put Pockets and Googles needs above user needs Privacy seems less important to them than new features When it comes to sending data to pocket saving searches the defaults should be to never do those things,2
319,Ruined a great browser Look and feel totally different Im forever wasting my time trying to learn a new interface for no good reason I use Brave browser now,1
320,Firefox always surprises me with new addons bells and whistles I had to get a new cell phone Im not tech savvy But Firefox made it so easy to set up with my everything,5
321,Decent browser but far from perfect However I felt the switch from Chrome which was a more user friendly browser was necessary,3
322,Uninstalled I greatly miss Firefox and look forward to using it again once you reenabled the ability to Print to pdf,2
323,I love Firefox always install it on any new device with big screen moto power 200 is major display love I use collection feature to capture brain storm activity or wiki boondoggle in math space,5
324,Whenever I download anything I get a error once I hit 100% I think the problem is where it sends the files I dont think it has a download folder even tho I have one in my files it wont go there and it doesnt let me change its location to sd card either not sure if its in my end but I dont think so cuz other browsers I try all work but this one so probably not me,1
325,Crash every time it is opens I can not rate the update since it will not open for me I guess I am stuck with chrome Update New phone and working Just app freezes when page is heavy graphics,1
326,Crashes all the time it sometimes gets stuck in a rotated mode if you were watching something in full screen a d hit the home button really tedious to use,2
327,Making progress Firefox I see theres is abotyom toolbar with Home bottom area Now Bookmark page needs some fixing Make Bookmarked icons small in order to fit them into one page Currently I have to scroll horizontal to find Bookmarked pages,4
328,Having issue when watching live video when closing the browser with the video playing it used to close out since the update it closes out however the audio/video still plays while the phone is locked mode It needs a fix please :(,2
329,Became better But still needs more work Right click/contextual menu does not work when using with a physical mouse This app is still inferior to Samsung internet,3
330,Ive used Firefox since before chrome was a thing I still love it too this day please support the open Internet and give Firefox a try love how we now have addon support on phones,5
331,You know its crazy as long as Ive been using this browser Im still just a little iffy about it Ill tell you one thing and it has came a long way since I started using it I mean back few years ago its came a long way since then,3
332,Removal of helpful features Adding popup tracking ads to the browsing experience Shortening browsing and tab history to just the last day with no search function Garbage I used to like Firefox Not anymore,1
333,Use to work fine no issues Recently it started crashing all the time and is very slow Now its unusable So I am looking for a new bowser for my android phone,3
334,Too bad there is no always display website as desktop feature and bad keyboard shortcut support on this browser It would be the n1 on tablet if it has this features I hope the dev hear me and add this in futur update,1
335,its a great app and launcher Im all about it then now and I see it in my future great app youll never use another not after you tried it goes hand in hand with Mozilla any if the the wikidata apps and tor one of my fav,5
336,loved Mozilla back in the day love Firefox now best plugins/themes easy setup on everything Linux windows Android arm versions of Linux that chrome fails on Firefox works tried and true,5
337,The new Homepage feature is a severe distraction I can no longer open pages saved to my desktop without clicking twice What once worked effectively is broken,1
338,Cant reorder bookmarks and have to do basically everything through the three dots instead of letting us have shortcuts on the toolbar The customize page is some seriously lacking BS,3
339,after a few months I gave it another try and it is just fine now I have Firefox on 2 other computers and love it,5
340,Offers you the option of a homepageNo place to set the homepage Mozilla does a great a job of completely destroying what was once a great browser,5
341,Too many problems Any text form entry slows the entire app to a crawl My daughters school website will not load at all on this browser Borderline unusable Galaxy S20FE,1
342,As long as Firefox doesnt keep popping up with multiple notifications day and night like Google did I know Ill love it,2
343,Been having minor issues Cant use the gif feature on sites like Facebook Cant enter content here Recently using Quit the app doesnt close It just says Deleting browser history,1
344,Nice look functionality and settings Noticeably slower performance than Chrome and I really dont see why they still dont have pull to refresh,3
345,years ago it was my go to for being fast not bloated and able use in low signal situations but now there isnt any pros for this browser over any other not with the storage space,3
346,Im 100% completely satisfied with this browser I cant believe all the options I have with it and best of all my business stays my business I recommend this app to any and everybody,5
347,Its like Chrome but good Lots of features here that I didnt realize I needed like readability mode and tabs synced between devices,4
348,Always loved FireFox especially on my desktop but Im upset about the mobile app blocking websites Ive been to for years I cant figure how to overcome it,3
349,Very professional Gave us a timeline and everything went according to that plan The installers were on time polite friendly and neat Is an effortless experience,5
350,Very good browser Have had no trouble  Its super fast and causes no problems I use Google but I also use firefox,5
351,The new update is awful Little things like being able to set a homepage are just gone For the first time I am actually deleting Firefox and using Chrome,1
352,Not exceptional at all and its screwing up just like Chrome does No exceptions at all Gmail account doesnt know anything anymore,2
353,It is refreshing to have a browser that doesnt bombard me with trackers With Google I felt almost like being stalked,4
354,Often lags out my phone shortly after opening the app New problem just started over the last couple months One plus 5 Love the app other wise,2
355,It was good until last update Where the f are the extensions And the upfate before I had to go in and shut off all of the stupid stupid things they added on by default,2
356,One of the features I really enjoyed in past versions was being able to reorder tabs I can no longer do that anymore and would like to be able to again Im not sure why it was removed,4
357,Unfortunately way too slow to load Often have to refresh from timed outs Samsungs default browser loads pages quicker than this,2
358,Used to be my go to browser Bookmarks are a mess the tabs absolutely suck and youre unable to turn them off usability has gotten much worse lately,1
359,A couple of additions and changes Id like to see but its probably the best browser Ive used Being able to use extensions alone clears it over Chrome by a mile,4
360,Cant complain about this browser Great for keeping my bookmarks organized features are simple and useful Cant go wrong in my opinion,4
361,Like a rum dumbs obsticle course trying to use this app It is a browser  do i really need to modify the settings every time i try and i dont use the word TRY lightly obviusly to search something  what a waste of data and even more importantly a waste of my time,1
362,After recent update it keeps crashing and I am loosing the tabs that I had open for reference Developers are incompetent and really do not consider the impact to the user community I would have given ZERO stars,1
363,I have tried very hard to like the new Fireworks since I really liked the old versionLove the fact that we can activate addons that we want however no news feed is a deal breaker,3
364,For an old dog learning new tricks(how to use  maintain proper accessingoperating various devicesappsetc Really helpful  onto of what I miss,5
365,Sometimes it just wont load anything even if I have a connection and the app is uptodate Just a blank tab with the written search or website no loading,1
366,Ive used CHROME and FIREFOX for years Less SPYING  TRACKING using FIREFOX than ANTI 1st AMENDMENT UNAMERICAN CHROME  GOOGLE Leave FACEBOOK TWITTER AMAZON too Send a message Their CENSORSHIP of PEOPLE  BUSINESSES WHOS OPINION DIFFER FROM THEIR SOCIALIST ONES have COINCIDENCES You KNOW what theyre doing Do YOU have the COURAGE to show them ALL that you BELIEVE in the RULE OF LAW  the US CONSTITUTION STAND FOR Help put an end to this BS FCUK THE DEEP STATE,1
367,I love it It feels comfortable like a nice big sweater (or your smell so so nice man  Then no sweater needed SHARING this oversized chair Then the one which is in the same spirit but brand ,5
368,Ive used Firefox for years and started advocating others to use it after version 4 was released Its been my preferred browser ever since,5
369,Got rid of lockwise and the browser cant autofill my password because I dont lock my phone Huge bug that doesnt let you use it with no phone pass genius Thanks Mozilla for this awesome feature,1
370,Best browser on the World Wide Weird Organized so even I can find what information I need online And the addons are customizable to your own needs Go Mo Go Mo,5
371,Everyone needs to stop using chrome Foirefox seems to be the best alternative I would like to see more customization though maybe custom homepage backgrounds and a true OLED Black Mode,4
372,Still hardly any addons available Still broke TOS by forcing update outside of playstore Closed tabs will reopen even after restarting the phone,1
373,someone used this app to take some of my accounts you should have to have your own account from Firefox before youre allowed to sync up with accounts outside of Firefox its a good app but the permissions any ability to steal other passwords in personal information from Android users bad,1
374,The only mobile browser you can install uBlock Origin on Makes the internet so much nicer especially on a phone,5
375,i want to support Firefox and thats why i use it On desktop it is painless but the Android version is noticeably worse than chrome Im guessing that google does that on purpose since they control Android,2
376,THIS APP IS NOW REQUIREDMORE THAN CHROME  IT WORKS WHEN CHROME BROWSER WONT WORKWITH SOME APPS  CONTACT SUPPORT IS NONEXISTENT  THERE IS NO HELP AND FEEDBACKONLY LAME SUGGESTIONS ,1
377,A/ this point in the game if I have to tell you about Firefox I dont have the words for you You know what it is It works everywhere on every OS and keeps me in sync,5
378,Great app I pray others would quit hang stalking me and make themselves of use to the lord instead of Lucifer Simply put though 5 stars good app,4
379,Latest update activates Homepage features I purposely deactivated in previous versions The option to use the Bookmarks screen as my Homepage still hasnt returned,1
380,Firefox constantly changes their settings layout so their support pages are never helpful They are not even aware of the current layout,2
381,May prove very helpful at new location Moving shortly and will need places and directions to and easy access,4
382,new tab page is very busy needs to be cleaned up and firefox is glitchy on desktop but still probably my favorite browser next to brave,4
383,I want to use FF full time but probably wont until form autofill for addresses is implemented Will update review once that lands on mobile,3
384,So easy to switch from Chrome to Firefox The app works great and I am a big fan of the privacy focus of the app,5
385,Firefox was a good option for me until recently It crashes just as much as Google,1
386,What kind of browser doesnt let you move/organize tabs A bad one called Firefox How has Firefox not fixed this in years Not to mention no tab groups,1
387,Very good Needs a Cast option available but this gives Chrome a run for its money Firefox is back,4
388,Ive always liked Firefox but I since Ive never used it on Android I think it was long overdue Still a great browser on the phone,4
389,None of the sneaky behind the scene changes like in other main browsers Firefox doesnt attempt to learn credit card info and gos know what other personal info other browsers so,2
390,With all of Netscapes experience I had expected much better it is Veryvery slow cumbersome and clunky unlike the Yandex browser that just does everything well and MUCH FASTER,2
391,the only downside is that if you close a tab and then the app immediately after the tab doesnt stay closed but other than that it works fine and respects your privacy,4
392,Great functionality and user friendly customization that is easy to use always liked this app to use as a browser,5
393,I use Firefox as my main browser on everything it supports I recommend it to everyone who wants a browser that leaves as final of digital fingerprints as possible,5
394,The search on search bar doesnt redirect me the Google site Its been like this for weeks This never gets fixed,1
395,Saved logins has never worked when I got this app on my phone and it really dissapoints me because on my computer it allows me but my phone dosent that dosent make any sense please fix this,1
396,Cant access sites that work just fine in chrome tried everything because I have used firefox for many years but have to have chrome for more and more unreachable sites,4
397,Love this app Secure private personalized and foxthemed What more could I want If I could donate to Mozilla I would,5
398,I like the way this browser blocks ads but it seems a little buggy on Android 11 It crashes my phone quite often and I have to reboot,3
399,The app is great but I wish I could somehow see how many tabs I have open past 100 5 stars if that can be done,4
400,well its like this folks since Ive been using Firefox as my browser I have no complaints not at all beats the hell out of that Chrome or Google I aint going to talk about Facebook he might as well kick that s*** right the hell out of the internet I had my fulfillment of all that they found out if someone wants to ask what was the best browser Id give him my Ace go around for Firefox havent found nothing better and mazola you stay put yall have a nice day now end of the story,5
401,App freezes for a short time on some pages but the ability to install ad blockers and other addons can still be worth the wait,3
402,FF is the best PERIOD I love the addons and its flawless functionality (so far),5
403,Why cant I filter shopping page I want to sort things by price or nearby I can do it in Chrome Why cant I do it in Firefox,3
404,it is okay but the ad blocker doesnt work all that well and some websites dont display right in the browser,3
405,I cant download pictures from the internet like I can with Chrome when I am using Firefox I wish that I could so that I could stop using Chrome forever,1
406,Im really disgusted that Mozilla removed about:config and wont let me connect to port 10080 They also removed the ability to delete one sites cookies,1
407,Least better than chrome Problem is downloads dont show up until they finished Before used to see what was downloading Not anymore,2
408,Cant print froma Firefox webpage in Android The share to printer option not given in Android Need an option to printstill no printing options,1
409,Love this app its so easy to use Never go back to Google again Like how it works thanks Firefox,5
410,Best independent browser Commercial browsers may put priority away from your own security in favor of provider profits Research how Microsoft handled Code Red and Nimda compromising security flaws for profit,5
411,Im a long time Firefox user and believer Theyve done a great job making the mobile app feel similar to the desktop version I love tab sync too,5
412,Samsung Tablet Experience: Where is the print dialog Why do you hide the entire webpage when I go to change the URL Why cant I search within the settings,1
413,Firefox with noscript addon fixes everything wrong with mobile web browsing Super fast Everything works Noscript blocks those putrid autoplay videos Thank you Mozilla,5
414,Works great I dont think Ive ever had any compatibility issues UI is solid/friendly,5
415,Horrible Pages refresh anytime you minimize the app to multitask and completely destroy/delete any progress you had on the webpage when you reaccess firefox,1
416,Bar none just continually and continuously the best browser there is From features security and add ins just the best,5
417,Firefox for Android is as functional as if it being run on a Microsoft Windows or Apples MacOs computer and tablets,5
418,I have been and will continue to keep Firefox as my Default Browser because I have found Firefox and Mozilla to do their utmost to KEEP their Users First in Both their Considerations of and in Implementation of their Best Practices,5

495,ABOSOLUTLY AMAZING  maneuverability excellent privacy tracking blocker his allaround amazing you guys hit it out of the park in my opinion this is a TEN star app,5
496,stuck with firefox cause chrome is like a creepy stalker very gitchy with these latest patches,1
497,Firefox is my favorite web browser of all time Its super fast and flexible,5
498,I wish I could more easily access with fewer taps my Bookmarks that are saved on my desktops Bookmark Toolbar,3
499,Rarely and randomly opens links in associated apps No longer a menu choice to do this manually,1
500,Its Firefox how could you mess up Firefox Better than Chrome simply because I really dont like Google I am aware Android is made by Google but I hate Apple more,1
501,Ive had no issues todate and have been using Firefox for years,5
502,very easily accessible and fast love the syncing with my computer browser way better than Google chrome,5
503,too many password issues otherwise terrific used on my old PC for 20 years,4
504,I want to like Firefox but the quality of the mobile version is just frustrating Any time I switch between Firefox and another app Firefox will automatically refresh the page Really annoying when trying to fill forms Also tabs constantly freeze and I have to close them and open a new tab Its been like this across multiple different phones now and for a long long time I have absolutely none of these issues in Chromium based browsers,2
505,UPD: back to 5 stars They fixed the annoying forced full screen I changed my fivestar review to two stars because of the latest update It keeps going full screen which pisses me off In terms of going back to home screen Ive got to freakingly swipe up two times not mentioning that the first swipe scrolls the heck out of the page to the end of the screen which I didnt intend to do Firefox What the hell starting today Im using a different browser Thank you,2
506,More update with less UI customization that was a reason why I use firefox over other browser New UI is optimized for bottom bar When I choose a TOP address bar Im expexted other menu at the top too Also I dont want to see anything in new page except blank Collection tab is a matter of privacy too Update: Still the same tab list is still optimized for bottom menu,3
507,Firefox had always been my default browser but I had to change this since last update Samsungs so useful bottom navigation bar suddenly disappears forcing users to several gestures just to go back to previous page There are also problems with text size Google search results for example abruptly get giant text size What has happened The app WAS really great,3
508,Used Firefox for years on various platforms On Android it has become rubbish It has become visually unappealing no longer shows all the tabs that have not been manually closed and arbitrarily deletes older ones It was worth 5 stars now its not really worth 1 I really would like to continue using it but not as it has become DuckDuckGo is going to be my goto browser from now on alternatively I may also consider Chrome a browser I have never liked,2
509,Been a firefox user ever since i converted but after the recent update my notification bar and buttons at the bottom disappeared Its extremely inconvenient to go back pages now with this The bottom bar actually does not take much space and needing to slide up everytime i wish to go back a page is quite convenient The extra space honestly doesnt do any good Hope the next update will revert it back to normal,2
510,I love Firefox and have always preferred it However the latest update which causes the back button to disappear (you have to slide up from the bottom) is stupid and not something I can imagine a lot of people have asked for The silly goal of trying to maximise screen space at any cost results in a very poor user experience People always want to go back and forth between websites and making it harder isnt the way to do that This + the change to websites being in groups = bad UI,2
511,Mozillas perseverance down a riskier but more innovative path should be applauded and thankfully its slowly finding its feet again Currently the only thing keeping me from Firefox as primary driver is atrocitious Android tablet usability  no desktop mode lock tab bar etc Also please bring back groups Chromium tab stacking is invaluable and the awkwardness of containers doesnt cut the mustard,2
512,The browser is great but it still suffers from the same problem which always been famous for on all operating systems from the day one After a while its speed slows down dramatically and takes up a lot of RAM space In particular the start up and opening speed slows to the point of regret But still its my default browser on phone and pc,3
513,Version 9710 broke full screen video on Samsung Galaxy S10 Lite These problems dont occur in Chrome 1 When I play a video full screen with the phone in landscape orientation the video doesnt take up the full height of the screen so the video is smaller than it should be 2 When I exit full screen mode and turn the phone back to portrait orientation the Android Navigation Bar is not present So Im stuck in Firefox and cant do anything else with my phone,1
514,Not bad Recently switched to Firefox after years using Yandex Firefox is slower and lacks Yandexs killer textreflow But at least it respects my choices by allowing me to install the extensions I want and doesnt bombard me with a moronic news feed full of vacant zzzelebrity junk every time I install an update Just get a decent textreflow function added will you Many websites are literally impossible to read on a tiny phone screen Why do so few browsers take this into account,3
515,Long time FF user Mobile app is just a bit rubbish its uncomfortable to use with the gestures for tab management requiring use of the whole screen The addons are a joke theres 17 of rhem Presumably this limit of whitelisted apps is due to the underlying method being problematic with security or stability Customisation of button layout again is limited Its missing most of what makes the desktop app good,2
516,I use Firefox all the time mostly so I can just listen to music with the Google browser in the background without having the music stopping like YouTube However an annoying thing that does happen is that the music stops when theres an ad in one of my other apps Its really annoying when I have to go back and restart it since I normally use desktop mode to listen to music in the background but when I go back to fix the issue it goes to mobile mode and wont go back on to desktop mode,3
517,Im having a problem after the last app update It keeps going full screen when I use it so I cant see the home button and back space key on my phone at the bottom or any of the icons at the top for time and internet connectivity This makes switching out of the app cumbersome and frustrating How do I change this feature It only happens with this internet app,2
518,I really like the new homepage with top sites and collections And clicking the search bar to access them is fantastic thats a great feature that other browsers dont have However when I click a top site or collection page it opens in a new tab instead of the same page This is so irritating You end up with 20 tabs on every session Its really annoying Please include an option to customise this,3
519,Update: Broken Sometimes when switching tasks the webpage will turn black and then even if I restart the app it will not respond Only way to fix it is to forcekill firefox in the OS settings Its been several years since the redesign and just as before we still have no way to close tabs when exiting the app and addon support is basically nonexistant Im very sad that this is the state of mobile firefox but as of now Im switching to Vivaldi,1
520,Becomes unusable overtime After a month or days or weeks I dont know whenwhat I experienced is when logging into an account or something type in the id password correctly and select log in it pops up something like resource not found no matter how many tries So I have to clear the data of this browser in settings every time when it happens Normally I dont mind but thing when it was something urgent it wasted my time and chance to fix something like banking,1
521,Lost functionalities: BitWarden does not work anymore Private Browsing history SYNCS with the desktop so it mixes there with the regular history Open in External App: nope preference setting needs to be manually selected EVERY SINGLE TIME And its slow sooo slow Pages load eventually mostly There is no reason anymore why I should use this browser Not fast anymore not private anymore not safe anymore But hey: we got rid of the word MASTER in master password1,1
522,the loss of scroll position is incredibly annoying it took me forever to find the new bugzilla instead of the black hole feedback is currently directed to and by then I didnt have the energy to write anything now I dont even remember the other bugs I wanted to report still better than chrome Edit: FFS now its suddenly fullscreen and theres no option to turn it off :( OTOH it seems to lose my scroll position less often now,2
523,App randomly (but regularly) goes into full screen mode hiding the entire android UI (including the home and back buttons) making it hard to switch to other apps or check notifications This is utterly frustrating and completely breaks the app This needs to be fixed before the app can be considered useable,1
524,Every update makes FF worse and worse This update has the full screen bug the previous update made it slower And the more features it adds the more bloated it gets Seriously guys just do one thing and do it well We just need a simple web browser with extension,1
525,This browser is opening new tabs whenever I enter another website on the address bar It didnt used to do that previously and before you realize it you have 10 tabs open I dont get why a new tab should be opened for a different site every time please fix this,1
526,I really dislike this redesign and many things either dont work or are missing I hate having no homepage and have a guess where a bookmark saved If you use Bing it wont let it go back with gestures or the arrows You have to close that tab open a new one for Bing then you can navigate backwards Lots of security holes and not repaired fast enough Let it supply an insecure password without special chars The Fenix coders are not open to suggestions in Github The nag page of whats new,1
527,there are quite a few bugs to fix and changes id like when resuming tabs after leaving firefox in the background sometimes the tab remains black and doesnt fix itself even after a refresh forcing me to close it the app crashes sometimes when i edit or delete a bookmark please let us select multiple bookmarks and reorder them as well as reorder tabs to make organization easier copying link text would also be appreciated,3
528,I switched to FF from Chrome some time ago and was extremely happy with FF performance But the last update brought a 34 second delay when I started the browser no matter what I tried Very annoying I will change to 5 stars once its fixed Update Feb2022: Well the performance has massively improved,3
529,Now randomly open external apps during browsing joke Should be 10 stars Why about:config doesnt work 2GB+ memory free and 3 tabs constantly refresh on change ffs So buggy time to look for the replacement its been going on for over 2 years now This app has surely been sold out Rainbow disease took over No more professional approach Who would ever agree for such of inconsistent design,1
530,I hate that the refresh button is annoying to access This browser really needs some quality of life updates for mobile users I use Firefox on PC and its a good browserThe mobile browser is okay overall because of ublock origin If some features like the refresh button and the tab menu will be improved ill change this review to 5 stars I hate how the Firefox devs make changes that no one wants needs or asked for just for the sake of change,4
531,I already used Chrome and Brave as my web browser for a long time ago Then my friend suggested me to use Firefox web browser At first I thought this browser will be boring like the other web browser But Im actually wrong this web browser is different than others You can use addons to improve your browsing experience Its look great visually IM HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THIS FIREFOX WEB BROWSER,5
532,The taskbar at the bottom stinks A finger is naturally at the bottom of the screen  every time I scroll up I end up with my finger going across the address bar  changing the page back to my last search After a week of persistence with the new version its still happening Lots of other things going wrong with the view of various regular websites I visit After years of wanting Firefox Im going back to google Stop promising updates/fixes listen to the reviews take it back to the original,1
533,Update: why do some websites go into full screen so I lose my top and bottom android controls Is this a new feature How do I disable it An utter disaster of an update Its buggy and I mean really obvious bugs and none of my addons work My web browsing experience has been totally ruined,1
534,Im using firefox on a tablet The new layout (v80) makes simple actions like changing tabs opening new tabs reloading etc extremely annoying due to the distance between the relevant buttons and the unstructured layout (e g: why are new tab new private tab and reload buttons not anywhere next to each other Or new tab and reload) Why is about:config no longer working On top of that come the obvious bugs I would really like to get back Firefox 78,2
535,I used to love firefox but the app is full of bugs Features working well suddenly disappear or get messed up with updates Filed reports are being ignored both on the support page and on github Im sick of it Sending tabs to another device is super annoying especially when you want to send AND close more at a time UX is stupid many times I emphasise again it is difficult to make your voice heard therefore this review,1
536,Please give me my buttons back The ones at the bottom (switch apps home back) that are part of the phones own system I have looked everywhere in the settings to stop them from disappearing and nothing works Those buttons are not optional I need them visible at all times,1
537,YMMV but this is the best Android browser for me in terms of balance between featurerichness and stability Its superb on highend phones and very good on lowend devices (I have both) A key feature is syncing of bookmarks etc across devices Edge is catching up but this seems just a tad less likely to go janky while scrolling,4
538,Well the developers fixed a big they introduced in their last update so I feel obligated to recognize that fact with a star There are still issues with fullscreen videos not being the correct aspect ratio depending on the source but at least it feels like these guys are trying,4
539,Update: what is the reason to open a pinned page in new tab when selected from address bar I mean really what is in your head When i select the address bar to choose a pinned page that page should open in the same tab If i want a new tab ill open a new one Its the end of 2021 and the bookmarks are still on the bottom of the list after the synced ones How lazy can you be 2022 now and nothing All the new added bookmarks are still at the bottom of the list when they should be on top,1
540,Well worth a try as an alternative browser its good to see more addons for mobile Did rate 4 stars its going to be 2 stars for now and 5 if fixedLatest update broke full screen video playback on samsung s10 Grey bars pop up where my back and home keys i have my home and back keys set to hide in my UI please fix this Edit fixed issue 5 stars as promised,4
541,everything is fine except for at least one significant problem: firefox doesnt open links to things like youtube wikipedia or reddit if you have the corresponding app installed which is an expected behaviour for an android browser you van only open the page in the corresponding app after youve opened it in firefox which frankly doesnt make sense in mobile world,3
542,1) Filling forms or using 2FA is almost impossible Changing app to read one information and then going back to Firefox cause the page to reload and loose everything filled so far in any forms 2) When resuming the browser the whole webpage is blank Reloading the page or typing another address does not work The only way is to close the tab and open a new one 3) Back button randomly not working 4) password manager not working with other apps,1
543,Ive been using Firefox in my daily life for more than a decade and its been my mobile browser of choice for more than four years its easy to use pretty upfront about privacy and allows for a bunch of options about customization and sync between the mobile and desktop versions,5
544,Ok but a couple of annoying things  it wont remember multiple logins for the same site (the way edge does) and also theres no option to just autofill the user name and not the password Also it constantly tries to reload pages when you switch tabs  this can be really irritating as it resets content when you dont want it to,3
545,Used to be good Since last update the browser keeps hiding the navigation bar despite the settings Toggling Scroll to hide tool bar on  off in customize menu seems to fix the problem for a moment but as soon as you change tab or leave the app the problem returns,2
546,20220208 now you cannot search your bookmarks or history This is getting worse Kids as developers 20220128 Useless cannot Print 20210109 Ver8414 This is getting progressively worse Now you cannot print web pages WHY REMOVE THIS FUNCTIONALITY IT WAS THERE BEFORE I updated There is no way to revert to version 811 This in addition with other issues not resolved by this release No method of sorting tabs Password access an issue,1
547,Latest update makes it so that in apps like Youtube where we go into fullscreen mode the back button Home button menu button etc of the phone are hidden once we go fullscreen the first time Meaning that you accidentally click on some random video instead of Back or Home Please fix asap,3
548,I ve always supported Firefox including donations paid This new update however is annoying Fullscreen all the time Who want that Fix it please Firefox we dont want auto full screen tabs and like all the time Media player in firefox is seriously bugged with no scroll to fast forward in full screen And sometimes to exit full screen you only have the option to use android back arrow Please roll out updates when beta is fully tested This is very bugged and flawed Thank you,1
549,Omg I close some tabs and close Firefox then later open Firefox and the tabs closed are again there whyyyyy is so annoying Really disturbing the last versions of 2022 am thinking to look for another alternative as Opera or whatever The user experience is worse right now And I cant print now in previous version I did,1
550,Id have rated this 5 stars in the past But the latest update has just killed that opinion off Sort the tabs out It sucks Go back to the old tabs function This new update is the laggiest browser Ive ever used Sometimes the tabs dont load at all Faster Wrong slower,1
551,Great Browser I work in digital forensics this browser doesnt delete history or data upon closure User always has to manually delete data which they often forget to do Which is GREAT for us in forensics but must be horrific on the end user Keep it up makes my job a little easier,4
552,Since everything only ever seems to get worse with each update maybe you should aim to make the app worse Maybe then itll get better again My theory might be wrong but its not like things can still get much worse at this point so you might as well try it anyway Alternatively you could also try replacing the entire dev team with a different one,2
553,The new Android firefox is so annoying and confusing to use the older one was so simple and easy I had to finally tell it to stop automatically closing tabs that I often use since they are easier to use than bookmarks,2
554,It is a great browser but I have 1 suggestion  When we search for some images on google and then click on them and try to download it it does not show any option to download  Also please add the back and forward button downwards  So please fix these  Then Ill give 5 star rating for your app ,4
555,Cannot download/save pictures Used to be able to press on them and get save options Now gone Why do you not listen and do something about things people highlight Another update and still they have not listened WHY DO YOU NOT LISTEN IF WE OPEN A PICTURE WE CANNOT SAVE/DOWNLOAD IT AND DO NOT REFER ME TO THE COMMUNITY STILL NOT LISTENING IDIOTS WILL NOT LISTEN UPDATE AFTER UPDATE AND STILL THEY DO NOTHING ABOUT IT DELETING,1
556,Great browser 4 star for external download manager support and privacy features and extension support Only one issue if you press back the whole app gets closed instead of the web page and after reopening the app the webpage stays the same Please repair your internal download manager it does not give any extra annotations for same name downloads instead it just download the multiple files and just keep the last downloaded one and every previous downloads just get vanished from the system,4
557,APK 6810 is better in every way For some reason playstore forceupdated again Still no support for all addons UI is cluttered The start pages are full of useless stuff Tab management is tedious And still most reviews are 13 stars and you are faking your rating,2
558,> New UI change: Whats with that dark background on some sites when I specifically pick LIGHT in the settings If the site has darker text it cannot be read > New UI change: Activate the now hidden back/home/switch app buttons via the tiny threedots icon located in the top right corner Who had this TERRIBLE idea [if youre the first to implement it there may be a reason for that (hint: because it is more than very bad)] > Less recent UI change: Bookmark management/search is subpar,2
559,Still using it but having to wait up to one minute for the first search results is just bad Every time I open it up whatever page I open first it takes up to a minute to work Opera and Chrome work just fine 510 seconds tops,3
560,Its a great app I use it on my computer and phone it do make things easier but the android version keeps crashing few minutes browsing and crashes again None of the updates so far fixed it its so annoying,3
561,Love the app but if there was a recent update it broke something Top android notification bar is empty If i swipe icons appear for a moment but soon disappear again Cannot see if i have a message or a miss call Icons return as soon as switch to another app,3
562,None of the issues I flagged before have been sorted and now the default to full screen That is not good Makes life harder Might well be the thing that makes me uninstall,1
563,loading is slow i mean if i click refresh it took me 2mins to fully load and when I open firefox after closed the loading time is also slow it took like 5 mins why the tittle says firefox fast and private browser but in reality its not that fast well the addon is good and useful but the reload speed and loading speed is slow,2
564,I used to love using Firefox until one day I decided to clear history thinking itll help being smooth with less baggage until it COMPLETELY wipe off the tab I have for later view I can feel my heart literally drop to the ground and my face turn pale white HOW AM I GOING TO REMEMBER ALL THE TAB I LEFT FOR LATER VIEWING ARE YOU DOING THIS TO GIVE PEOPLE STUNNED HEART ATTACK AFTER ALL THE TIME I SPENT FINDING THEM AND JUST CHUCK THEM INTO THE OBLIVION NOOOOOOOO ALL MY TABBBBBBBBBBBBB,1
565,For anyone having the a video with a bar covering it do this Bring down your notifications and that should remove it Please firefox update to fix this issue as well as the missing missing and on screen buttons at times Edit: fixed earlier issue but not a black bar on top and bottom part of video is cut off,1
566,I am missing the full page option in this ff app When reading news and a video is also available to view it is impossible to watch it when the top bar is constantly covering half of the screen when the phone is rotated,2
567,I keep checking for updates to see if all the recent issues have been fixed Notably the full screen problems as well as full screen YouTube videos not working properly Disappointing,3
568,I installed this app after being away for years because a friend told me I can get a bottom address bar However no website would load unless I disable AdGuard All the other browsers have tried didnt seem to have this issue,1
569,Best browser on Android If you want a good browsing experience that isnt riddled with ads and crosswebsite tracking please use this Firefox is a name familiar to every person using a computer and the pros of the desktop version are present here also,5
570,I used to love Firefox but now it has turned into a endless tab mess Why do you need a new tab for every time you type an address Using bookmarks Good luck Since there is no way to change this I am moving on to a browser that doesnt have this hell,1
571,Makes you wonder how theyre struggling so much to produce a good browser for a web thats designed around mobile A lot of websites have popup prompts for cookies/other settings that keep disappearing off screen Fix your browser,4
572,Why anytime I minimize the app for 5 seconds and come back to it it will have to reload my page all over again Please fix it Is so annoying  That is the only problem I have with it then I will rate it five star,1
573,THE TABS JUST WONT CLOSE The same issue has persisted for who knows how long Tabs just keep reappearing over and over and I end up with hundreds of tabs of things like google searches and old redirect windows that I keep having to go back and delete multiple times Whats the deal,2
574,The latest updates have gone from bad to worse multiple crashes slow image loading sometimes pages will just not render crashes certain videos players do not enter full screen properly app getting stuck in landscape mode crashes,1
575,After recent update annoying change (or maybe its a bug) was brought in Top and bottom Android navigation bars keep getting hidden and its really awkward to get them to show again  there should be a setting to turn this off,2
576,The design is horrible its a far cry from the desktop version Theres barely any customization and theres a few bugs in the current version (9710) Whenever Im entering fullscreen theres a weird bar on the bottom I think its the toolbar since its default position is on the bottom of the screen,1
577,Good browser i suggest to add tabgrupping option There is one problem everytime when you leave tabs opened as desktopsite it goes back to mobile view and the button does not work anymore its still red but doesnt turn off or on  just is freezed Please fix it its very annoying,3
578,Quite a good experience (when it comes for fast speed connection and etc) but when I add the addons to protect my personal stuff it suddenly became a questionable experience Im very sorry but I had to give this an 3 stars,3
579,The only thing I dont like is whenever I want to go to a new website on a current webpage a new tab will open instead of using the current webpage to go to the new website It also refreshes in the background after a while,3
580,Have used this app for a long time but latest update has introduced bugs Constantly hiding the back and home buttons requiring an extra click on the address bar to go back in the browser big block of colour at the bottom of fullscreen videos in youtube,2
581,new feature of hiding system ui is extremely undesireable not to mention bugged as well as it renders the firefox nav bar unresponsive while active making the browser unusable ive had to download a new browser and drop firefox unfortunately,1
582,Partnering with Meta(aka Facebook) for ad tracking No thanks Switching with Brave The only selling point Firefox had was privacy but now you lost it and there is now excuse for us to use your inferior browser compared to the competition,2
583,Whats the benefit of having a privately secure browser if important elements on the website wont load Sites as Wikipedia dont load images and difm doesnt load the menu icon No addons the enhanced privacy is off the normal browsing not the private mode Your app is flawed,1
584,Great app just one problem About ETP Redirect trackers Clears cookies set by redirects to known tracking websites what does it mean Did the cookies set by redirects got cleared because it is a known track website Im confused,4
585,Its really fast I switched to their service after Google wouldnt let me login using my Google account After installing Firefox I was able to login perfectly fine and I also noticed a huge difference from Chrome: This app is really and I mean REALLY fast and I havent experienced any glitch or crashes since Ive been using it Thank you Firefox,5
586,Its like each update is bringing more bugs When any link is opened in another app the status bar is getting hidden When Im using any site watching full screen video and once Im out both navigation and status bar are getting hidden Id love using firefox but these little bugs everywhere are annoying,2
587,Why are so many 5star reviews actually critical of the browser Are you tricking people The average went from 3x to 45 inside a year and it doesnt look legit Ive lost faith Oh and the newest update is preventing the phone from going into standby if Firefox is open Opening a new tab is janky password manager bounces up and down Dislike how Firefox handles bookmarks and offers few user customisation options At least there is *some* addon support best blocking on mobile,1
588,Firefox uses too much ram I found a bug in the built in download manager When I download any file it downloads and shows the progress in the notification area but if I want to go to downloads menu it shows nothing is downloading,2
589,Overall a very good app my only complaint is the fact that you cannot delete just a specific website from your history having to delete all of it,4
590,Latest update changed UI to some unusable huge blobs when switching tabs I cant find a way to bring back old UI Apart from this you cant delete some history you can erase only all of it,1
591,Its really annoying that every time i go to a new site it creates automatically a new tab I have spent quite a lot of time trying to find out how to stop this unwanted behavior I gave up Now Im using another browser,1
592,Android Share Menu > Bookmark with firefox is removed Print option removed Even from Reader View Everyday Firefox loses more features that make it Firefox Bitwarden autofill doesnt work with Firefox Android Fix it please,1
593,Really good app has majority of chrome features and more not intrusive like chrome keeps me private Only needs to add casting feature then for me 5 stars would be applicable Please add casting feature it s about time,4
594,I love the browser very much but whenever I want to upload a file it crashes on my Redmi Note 10s Its a major problem for me Fix the issue as soon as possible and Ill definitely rate 5 stars,3
595,Its now much faster loading it also lays out beautifully many sites others do not in landscape and portrait but fails on loading some Google based web apps like eg Kosmiapp fix that its 5 out of 5 then that and adding plugin extensions,3
596,I still yearn for the days where this browser was hands down the best browser Id ever used now its just full of features that I know for a fact could be handled better Latest update broke fullscreen videos completely :/,5
597,Is there a way to turn off on screen download confirmation and notification I often download lots of images docs and sound files and being asked to confirm download for each every file is very time consuming and stresful tbh Also the download notif onscreen isnt helping with it blocking the link in my screen its big size definitely not helping too Those above is what i think holding this app back from a 5* masterpiece please give it some consideration Thank you,2
598,New browser is clumsy at best Horrible new tab feature for normal and private Tabs stay open under some unattended group It just feels bad overall Moving back to v 68121 the best version of Firefox,2
599,What a downfall for Firefox on Mobileout of curiosity have you ever tried to use Edge before you claim fastest I am one of first to embrace FF on PC and still use However your mob app is a disgrace,1
600,Each update just seems to make it worse Sadly moving away from FF after all these years Why remove a basic feature such as adding a bookmark to home screen ,2
601,From version 96 it gets only 3 stars Huge performance drop Sometimes I must unload the app to avoid no internet connection message Its not funny as far as all other apps continue working great with internet,3
602,Only way the devlopers can turn this browser around again is by working with more extension developers and porting them to Android Version (a lot of them work perfectly btw on development versions and forks) Development looks stale And no signs of features like DNS over HTTPs,3
603,Its ok it functions Need to add an easy way to refresh the page like drag down to refresh or similar like any standard android browsers have,3
604,• loading pages EXTREMELY slowly compared to other browsers (avg of 65 seconds compared to 1 second using chrome and 25 seconds using opera) • no pull to refresh (a feature literally every browser has) an amazing browser for windows but for android its meh at best,3
605,Not sure yet Firefox is constantly giving me new notification when I open it Rate this select that what is new main browser that pin that sync this It feels worse than visiting new page that asks for all of that cookies and notifications,1
606,After the latest update fullscreen mode (fullscreen video) started to glitch heavily with hiding the navigation bar continuing the timehonored tradition of Mozilla to more often make Firefox worse than better with updates,2
607,everything works fine pictureinpicture is great but dont try and work with images they will forever load trying to save it and if i press share image the app crashes,3
608,Please make Bookmarks visable which I use all the time I do not use collections Easy access to open Bookmarks is essential  is now barely usable in the latest update ,1
609,Because of the movable adress bar your browser renders elements with position fixed wrongly when orientation changes Its especially valid for those that stick to the bottom of the page,4
610,Generally very happy with Firefox and love the add ons My only criticism is that the volume of played media eg YouTube is way too low Can this be fixed,4
611,Great keep up the good work but please close tabs after leaving page (there is NO option to do this) as its annoying to still see them when I open the browser again,4
612,I have selected delete browsing data on quit and ticked all boxes But I was shocked to see in the App list that the cache size was still 638 Mb I repeatedly perfomed quit but nothing was deleted Not sure if this is a bug or deliberately done,1
613,I had an easy transfer from Chome to Firefox All passwords and bookmarks came across Only item missing was the icons for the bookmarks which reappeared when the bookmark was accessed,3
614,THE BEST BROWSER EVER I use it on pc on mac on android and Id probably use it on my fridge if it supported it Down and out with g****e monopoly all hail the independent browsing,5
615,Stopped using Android version most of the time It no longer close all tabs on exit so you are left with lots of tabs open Very annoying,1
616,Almost the best browser but sometimes when it works as a builtin browser it has some issues: screen just turn black and nothing you can do Ps: please add dark theme for reader mode,3
617,Good exp so far though the theme doesnt always follow my phones setting (sunrise/sunset) Might be good if maybe Firefox had its own sunrise/sunset setting or detected the change faster,4
618,Give us beta programme inside playstore page please dont make it a separate app Like Firefox Focus does Also similar to how Chrome allows you to optin to (early updates) without getting a new app Simply by scrolling to the bottom of this page and pressing a beta button Other apps like Edge do it too for early bugfixes  features,3
619,Files downloaded commence but never complete It shows in your notifications as downloading but doesnt end and its not possible to cancel the download If you want to get rid of the notification you have to restart you phone Not good enough if you want to compete with chrome Also new UI is pretty bad,1
620,Update Feb 2022 has rendered the app unusable All I get are error messages when loading pages I have to use Chrome What is going on,1
621,The download manager was too bugs When Im trying to download any files it doesnt show the download status in the download section but it shows only when download is completed but we cant get to know the download status please fix this issue,2
622,Browser is good but some more features should be added like: print save as PDF mouse cursor always open will be desktop site any pages Then make will be best browser from puffin web browser and get rating 5 star So next update these features should be added,3
623,Was surprised when the app went full screen Really a great feature to cover the whole screen and hide the status bar on top I wish it could be disabled though,4
624,Not that good for android cant even read reviews on Google I have to switch to desktop mode to see the reviews and many more bugs or missing features On windows I have no problems with firefox,2
625,Underdeveloped compared to the desktop application Many things just do not work you cant even download images on Google,1
626,Full screen YouTube no longer works: grey bars cover parts of the screen Sometimes the Firefox toolbars disappear I left Chrome because they kept breaking things are you going to break this also,1
627,Firefox for Android is now as great as the desktop counterpart extension support is a must and Firefox surely delivers in this area A must have 5 stars all the way,5
628,As Mozilla are working with meta I shall watch closely and probably stop using Firefox and use brave instead Very disappointing from a company that usually understand the issues of improving privacy not watering it down,2
629,no way to switch it permanently to a desktop web versions Makes it unusable for large tablets Mobile web page on a 12 or 14 inch tablet just isnt pleasant experience,1
630,Firefox is just the best Sometimes I try out other hyped browsers and I always get back to Firefox The most reliable of all best sync across multiple devices,5
631,I dont know about others but for me this browser have the best interface Ive been using it since Firefox introduce new interface if only the add on can be use like back then,5
632,Cannot replace google search with duckduckgo Cannot automatically switch to new tab when clicking a link Not a patch on th windows version that I love ,1
633,Constant change in program architecture upsets users These changes are not improvements if anything they are changes made for the benefit of the software developers and its related often outsourcrd data skimming When do these people understand Users are not to be used as ,1
634,Works OK Seriously lacks options to see tabs bar under address bar and bookmarks bar Ability to group tabs open link in group tab would be big plus too,3
635,Excellent Browser The ONLY one to trust with your data Edge Chrome and safari are all owned and controlled by multibillion dollar companies,5
636,I like the new update I mean it is not perfect But for the first version after such massive redesign it is OK Im looking forward for updates with new features and plugins Thank you,4
637,This new update has many problems Second is that it seems this has even less privacy We cannot save login name without password If you want to save login info you need to save the password also We cannot save only login account This was not the case in earlier version Very bad Second problem is that there is very little space between the cut option and the written content in the search box If you need to write ahead of the text in search bar pressing at that place press the cut,2
638,Every day seems to have a new update I dont have any other browser that updates so frequently cant they get it right Improved somewhat but not enough to make it a default Samsung my default,3
639,All time Firefox users from Web to Mobile Felt Firefox were faster and Chrome Mobile have too many trackers Hope Im wrong about Chrome as ive used Mobile version for a very long time already,1
640,Why is there no translate addon for Firefox on Android what kind mobile web browser doesnt have a translation tool inbuilt No wonder people go for Google Chrome and chromium based browsers Please fix this ASAP,1
641,Recent updates messed up everything went from most reliable to least reliable browser Im experiencing the same issues as the rest of these 1 start reviews,1
642,Was using Firefox on Samsung tablet w no sim in desktop mode to access WhatsApp As of recent update (cant prove this caused it but) no longer working so why do I need another browser,1
643,The browser is awesome but it isnt properly optimized for the Android tabs And the more extensions should be added to the mobile version,3
644,Bring back the option Show images Who is that smart person in the company that decided to cut it out Firefox was the only browser for Android allowing turning off images when it needed,1
645,I tried a few browsers and settled on this one Has all the settings I need and more importantly the address bar at the bottom,5
646,My favourite browser by far Fast easy to use features very customizable Sync feature is a great backup tool makes working on multiple devices so easy Great addons too Lots to like highly recommended,5
647,Really disliking this you dont know what you want notion of adding Pocket to my homepage or giving tips during browsing when I want Firefox to stay minimal and focused for an ADHD user like myself,2
648,This browser is great but there are some problems like the browser is really slow which makes me to uninstall this app because I am a student I need a fast browser Apart from this this app is great,3
649,Usually love the app but it looks like an update has made that my navigation bar keeps disappearing and I have to swipe to get it back Really annoying as theres no setting to change this,2
650,Will never go back to Chrome Its becoming too memory hog for 4 GB phones Both on Debian based PC and Android smartphone Firefox is and will be my only primary Internet browser period,1
651,After discovering Kiwi Browser noticed just how lacking the new direction of Firefox is My advice just copy most of what that browser has,2
652,Well they fixed the Immersive Mode bug but how did that latest update even make it through QA My confidence in Mozilla is at an all time low think its time to switch to Fennec,3
653,Pros: •Great esthetic •Address bar with bottom orientation •New tabs open with cruiser auto positioned in address bar •Left/right swipe on address bar to navigate tabs Cons: No magnifier for text selection,4
654,Better than Chrome but still shite How about more addons or cookie control video block audio block Just not streamlined to a quicker web experience,3
655,Bring back the both adress and bottom action bar Its so bad like this dissapearing instead set the option for full screen or not,1
656,Not bad Firefox you fix many bug better chrome Chrome he every time update he Just update only no tell us he fix what bug and we tell him anybug dont know him know or not so you better than Chrome Fire Fox Do you Best,4
657,Love Firefox generally but dislike the switch button when opening new tab Why cant it be like pc open in background or next,3
658,Why cant you just let us use any extensions from the desktop version I know that is gonna effect phones battery and Ram consumption but using extensions is optional so i dont see any point why you dont give full support for all extension,3
659,I found some privacy settings missing like https everywhere secure dns dns over https site isolation etc which are available in desktop app Please add these settings in android and make it more secure,3
660,Fast secure and good looking browser with everything you need I love the possibility for addons,5
661,Perfect browser for android besides it doesnt have an option for allowing popups and all those things its the best browser for its addons and great performance,5
662,BE AWARE  Usage data collection is on by default Tracking protection needs to be turned to strict mode manually Firefox should ask before stealing personal data 🤯,1
663,Finally a browser with working AdBlock  Addons features on Android Good job Firefox ‍ but theres one thing that miss its probably Translate Page,4
664, Android menu(home button) and back toolbar missingneed to constantly slide top menu to bring it back Worst web navigation,1
665,It keeps opening new tab by default I dont know how to fix it yet Yes Fix Because thats what we consider broken,3
666,Last update brought annoying bug firefox hides top and bottom bars automatically I really hate this improvement,1
667,missing page view to select url there is only text menu available Tell us more optional is partly readable,1
668,Poor update have to downgrade due to everytime key new address to go in visited sites Older version will have tab shown or bookmark easily,2
669,very user orientated easy to use easy to set up  easy to adapt to personal preferences like private browsing,5
670,Saves images in webp format which is practically unusable uninstalling app and wont use again until this is resolved,1
671,Crash on crash Full reinstall may have solved this but log ins lost And now cosying up to Facebook Uninstalling,1
672,Browser is good in my opinion But this application need more futures like JavaScript setting(like disable enable JavaScript ) and always desktop mod ( my own opinion of site cookes setting i am not understand the settings ),3
673,feels really good and fast on android compared to chrome and sync with desktop works well most of the time (sometimes it takes 30 seconds or more to send a tab to desktop),4
674,The new UI is weird and keeps making the bottom bar in youtube disappear unless I open FF settings Really annoying as I cant access me subscriptions or playlists without the bottom bar,2
675,I always liked firefox more over chrome Despite it having a lot of bugs i would chose firefox over chrome anyday,4
676,Desktop site doesnt work Should allow reordering of top and  menu customization Sync doesnt allow me to log in,2
677,YouTube behaves bad in firefox Youtube video full screen issue with the new update Navigation bar showsup in fullscreen It was good in previous version,1
678,There doesnt appear to be a working password generator and the password capture functionality isnt as good as Chromes,3
679,This browser is irritating and stands nowhere compared to other leading ones I have a very bad exp with this Firstly the app when downloading something does not show it in downloads section We have to check progress in notification section Also it is slower I had firefox in windows also and I disastrously got a problem and had to remove windows I installed ubuntu and signed in with same account and was expecting my history passwords and pinned tabs would appear in ubuntu Bt no They al,1
680,Its a Better Browser For Ads Blocking and Surf Internet But its Download Feature are Not Good for Pause or resume  add a option for it ,3
681,Currently losing 1 star: after recent updates Firefox covers the Android notification bar and navigation buttons needs fixed,1
682,updated after a couple of years new ui is horrible tabs are hard to use they are too large so cant observe them all without scroll and closing cross button is easy to miss so the tab opens instead of closing very annoying typing in url should include bookmark suggestions and past sites but it doesnt suggest anything just to name a few regret Ive updated as always,2
683,much better with recent update altho having to reset all app settings after update annoying(eg saving passwords/autoplay vids etc) can deal with that tho,3
684,Hi I recently update to 9710 I see a thick white bar on the bottom of the screen whe I see youtube videos on full screen mode on mozila,1
685,theres no other privacy browser for Android the default android browsers send all your tracking data to Google Firefox doesnt,1
686,Great browser great selection of options and simple to navigate through menus,5
687,I am currently trying out Brave going on two weeks now which feels like Firefoxs younger brother to me but I dont think Id be using it if I hadnt switched from Chrome to Firefox 4 years ago I immediately fell in love with this browser and will never remove it from my routine Thank you Mozilla for instilling in me the pride  relief of awareness control and privacy of my online actions,5
688,The browser is working fine However I am not able to add Home Screen shortcuts Neither Install App nor Add to Hone Screen works,3
689,A while ago the Daylight release obliterated Firefoxs features and left the UI buggy and badly designed Even standard features like address bar suggestions from history are astonishingly bad Theyve made tiny improvements since launch but momentum completely slowed months ago and longstanding bugs remain unfixed Its pretty clear that Mozilla simply doesnt care about offering a useful experience on mobile Firefox for Android is pretty much the new IE6 left out to rot,1
690,The only reason I use this is because it can be added with ublock origin which is the best ad blocker i know,4
691,Literally every update makes the app worse to use Also has been almost a year and 99% of the add ons arent able to be used despite Mozilla saying otherwise,1
692,The app is good overall However I do feel like in the design department it could be improved I feel like the search bar and the toolbar should not be in the same level or like we could have the option to not have them at that Though i do like that we can move it to the bottom Though the other aspects I am okay with/ am really satisfied,3
693,Best Web browser out there easy and simple to use and navigate through tabs Overall quick and simple Would recommend to you,5
694,Love this Im seriously visually impaired and its so much easier to see cos uv got dark mode and the text seems larger,5
695,Okay I dont what is what anymore All of sudden the Mozilla app is no longer user friendly It Sucks I can no longer navigate to anywhere Like what the hack I might as well delete it,3
696,Browser crash so much it broke my phone and force a restart Only good for referencing saved password,1
697,Hey I cant write in the search bar from firefox browser in my Nvidia Shield Android TV Pro 11 using my remote control but I can do it with Odin and other cheaper browsers 🤔,4
698,You cant disable the forced immersive mode (full screen so you cant see the status bar anymore),2
699,I used to love this browser it was my go to and now I cant use it anymore The websites refresh immediately after I switch to a different app which makes some flows completely impossible I cant log in to PayPal on a website by going to my password manager because if I go out of Firefox the site refreshes and I lose my cart and have to start all over again Also sometimes tabs just freeze up and go completely black I have to delete them because otherwise they dont work Terrible So sad,1
700,Opara is better Opera and Samsung Web browser dont use Google captcha Mozila dont care about the users and can only sell your information to Google or other 3rd party companies,2
701,What a disaster IMHO They still havent fixed the problems I listed Ex private tabs are a separate shortcut Every time you open Firefox you have to click back to get out of search mode to access bookmarks Once open even if you minimize it briefly you have to click back to get out of search mode again then click on the tab number then choose the previous tab Just too difficult to use now Horrible They say they update it but they never fix it,1
702,With new update app goes to full screen mode on homepage and some sites There is no option in settings to turn it off :(,2
703,Best Browser in the World Has never been dishonest Always ez to use with all privacy extentions and support That said please fix: 1 Print 2 Fullscreen so hides my nav and status bars 3 Landscape mode sometimes cuts off parts of screen,5
704,If youre running away from Chrome tread carefully here this is not the Firefox you used to know its been compromised Firefox is no better than Chrome any longer concerning speed Firefox is snail mail Chrome is better by far The qualities have been removed Unlike before addons have been limited Only download Firefox as a last resort Yes its as bad as that,1
705,There is no print option on Firefox Android menus are gone and explanation on website is outdated,1
706,Full screen video is no longer full screen with a huge border either directly under the video or to the right side of the video,1
707,Fixes things that arent broken An inconsistent and unstable app Frequently affected by bugs,1
708,Do not use if you care about your privacy Firefox is the least secure browser It leaks all your information to advertisers,1
709,Since the new update most of the addons I had installed stopped working which is upsetting The big advantage of Firefox are the addons and you just give it away Why even updating when not everything is working For people who could not await this update there was Firefox beta We would like to enable support for more extensions on the new Firefox for Android experience and we are currently evaluating ways we can do so without  Why didnt you evaluate it before this big change,2
710,Rubberbanding issue in Google image search when swiping left or right still persists Swiping up doesnt bring up the address bar until you reach top of the page,2
711,Lacks basic functions like Swipe Down to Reload and proper full screen of videos Besides that its pretty good,3
712,Im glad I finally managed to ditch Chrome for good and return to Firefox after 7 years My experience has been amazing so far and way better than with Chrome I mean the addons feature by itself is enough to make Firefox superior I also very much like the layout and the colors and I feel like theres a sharpening filter applied or something and its just so good to look at,5
713,Jumped to firefox due to the option  auto play disable for video 1st used chrome after sometime videos autoplaying become quite disturbingthen tried edge brower last couple of months edge also removed option to stop autoplay,1
714,If you value your privacy and an open internet you cant go wrong with Firefox I switched from Chrome a few days back and glad I did You can import your data quickly and everything works as you would expect in Firefox Not had any problems and everything just works added bonus much less data harvesting I would encourage more people to look into firefox as an alternative and support an open internet free from data harvesting,5
715,After all these years Im finding it harder to use So will move to different browser for time being,5
716,Although the new changes are a bit rough around the edges Ill be patient Firefox has always been my favorite and will be my favorite Amazing work Mozilla ,4
717,Still waiting for umatrix to become available in extensions Other privacy / script blocking extensions are not that easy to use on mobile,3
718,Sort out the bookmarks please esprcially the frequently used ones as that was one of the reasons I liked about this browser Getting a bit more used to it but it still seems a bit long winded but maybe over time Ill be OK with it EDIT Getting much more used to it now and its certainly better than when this update happened so Im reasonably happy with it now although I still wouldnt mind the most accessed sites improved slightly tweaked even,4
719,So this is my new review Firefox for Android has improved a lot over the years and I think it is one of the best web browsers for mobile It has a nice UI and most of the necessary features Although it has got some very important features that are missing Once you open tabs you cant rearrange them ie tab reordering is absent which is present in all the other browsers that I have ever used Also no tab grouping  collections dont sync with the desktop app,4
720,I dont know what happened to Firefox Firefox was one of my top picks when it comes to browsers I redownloaded Firefox after taking a break from it and trying new browsers and this app has gone from king to beggar EVERY page I go to takes about 35 minutes to load And no its not a network problem Chrome works fine in the same network at the same time And this error happens EVERY TIME so now Im frustrated Deleting this for now,1
721,Where did the print feature go  Its was one the most important features for me every other browser has this feature There is no print feature even within the share option Bring it back with the next update After the 79 version quite a few features have been removed Why do you have to do this  And also add the feature to group tabs its quite useful The app lags a lot thats another headache Everything else is top notch,1
722,The best browser ever Customisable secure fast Use it both on my phone and laptop,5
723,Useless web browser for me You are removing essential features For example in recent versions it is no longer possible to save web page as PDF And addons that were previously working just fine (for examples SingeFile or any addon to save or print webpage as PDF) do not work with recent versions and its not addons developers fault There were forum discussions on it and there are no plans to fix it according to forum responses Why are you limiting Android users in such way :(,1
724,sliding between photos on google is super buggy and iritating until then im staying with chrome,1
725,Cant take long screenshot When I open video in full screen it shows a grey bar at bottom and once I exit full screen player it hides notification bar and navigation bar,1
726,Every update makes things worse which is a shame because even with how bad things have gotten with this browser it is still the best one on mobile Its just a ghost of its former self is all Though it does have plus sides like the use of addons which are still gutted compared to older versions No other browser I have tried has had that option,1
727,Firefox is better than Brave n Edge as its the only browser which provides Addons support for Android Theme n UI makes it more convenient for me to use,4
728,this is an ideal browser for me i love foxes and open source software,5
729,It is not properly working at the time of EPFO services But it is the default browser for EPFO services why  It is very slow,3
730,The fact that you can get a specific website timer/blocker (Leechblocker addon) makes it unique and for that its 5 stars Completely changed how I use my phone Wishlist: address autofill feature make the tab drawer snappier and more kinetic (also doesnt need to be a pullout drawer UI style  could use the extra space in grid mode) Thanks for working on this alternative so appreciative,5
731,I like the app Would especially like it if there was a search bar to find and tag filter bookmarks appropriately,4
732,I use to use Firefox years ago cant see why its took me so long to come back to it ,5
733,Far nicer than using Chrome though still feels as if the dev team do not really use the browser much themselves Two years later we are still unable to install extensions other than the dozen or so that have been approved and the back button has been broken for months (you go to a site even simple mailman mailing list pages and the back button is just an infinite loop as it pushes the page you just were on to the top of the stack),3
734,Extensions available shouldnt be different in Phone from Desktops extensions Other than that perfect,4
735,Bookmarks management is a nightmare with Firefox The interface in general is not very practical Ill be looking for alternatives But its just so practical to have the same Firefox account linked between all devices Very frustrating that the smartphone version of the browser be so much behind the desktop version Very disappointing,2
736,can not add bookmark in to spesified folder can not move bookmark between folder i can do them on firefox lite,1
737,Easy to use many extension for PC 1 account many benefit Nonprofit they say but it feels like im buying premium apps,4
738,After the last update when I play a full screen video it shows a thick purple bar and the video shows only in about 60% of the screen,2
739,Perfection The browser the engine I really like their performance Well done Mozilla,5
740,An almost perfect browser I can disable ads and view any website in dark mode It just needs a little more configurability like letting me choose my own home screen or if you want me to only use your home screen then please make it more configurable And please make tab sizes more adjustable so I can see more of them Then it would be a perfect browser,4
741,Best browser on Android or Windows The addons work on both versions You can use u block origin to block pesky YT ads,5
742,I am VERY deeply tied in to Google Ecosystem  Gmail Docs Photos etc Naturally Chrome has been my go to browser on all devices However lately Ive had growing concerns on the data being collected by Chrome I was not sure if any other browser would fill Chromes place But I was willing to give them all a try Long story short been using Firefox since about a week and I feel much better and safer on the Internet and have had no moments where Ive missed Chrome Best browser hands down,4
743,Not working in gesture mode in my android device it have small blue borders below the video screen and its annoying,2
744,I have problem on youtube When the video aspect ratio is 18:9 in full screen the lower part of the video was cut,2
745,What has happened Ive been unable to set my own homepage ( a major down for me) I couldnt get rid of Google as the search Eng I like many others dislike Google Limited add ons Nothing to like really for me Seems to have lost its way in relation to privacy Please leave the windows version alone I think it now syncs with other devices Big deal who cares I prefer privacy Get back on track please,1
746,A very good browser Ive got to say that it improved alot over time It wasnt a good one previously but now it is one of the best,4
747,I used to use a Browser called Brave unfortunately it had some glitches way too many affecting my experience and webpages werent loading fast enough so I was looking for alternatives Most browsers are chromium based and tried those and they felt just as sluggish as Brave but after trying this Browser I was absolutely impressed Firefox has such a swift UI and loading webpages are really fast It also allows extensions which enhance the experience and more I recommend you try this ,4
748,I want to move away from Chrome so Firefox felt like the next best option Duckduckgo is nice too but I dont like the UI I have complaints though: switching between tabs refreshing the page among others should be a 1 step process: not having to go into the hamburger menu to do so Look at what Chrome does well for its users and incorporate those/similar features If you want to beat the competition,3
749,Updated (orig reviewed Nov 2021) Coming back to FF after a while away due to poor design choices previously and unfortunately not really any improvement Bookmarks are still a pain to manage tabs cant be reorganized and theyre still trying to shove useless festures like pocket in Frustrating as I love PC FF but the app continues to disappoint,2
750,much better than Chrome in terms of privacy and interface However I noticed a bug when you open the app from the app tray after some background time the tabs in the private section do not refresh as they should Annoyingly they refresh but all tabs have the same adresses as that of the first private tab Hope you fix this soon Theres nowhere to report a bug so have to use this as of now,4
751,Stop restoring sessions when the Web page is causing the browser to crash We cant load the pages here is a error message lets spend the next hour repeating The ability to disable caching every option of clearing it on exit hasnt worked since the version 60 release Sync works only when it wants too also syncs garbage,1
752,Love and use Firefox on Windows On Android its another thing and according to reviews have been for a long time A few examples: *Not possible to set an encrypted DNS (other browsers have this via UI FF even missing about:config where it can be set) *Option missing for adding WebApps/URLs to homescreen *No refresh when swiping down from to top of page  Not possible to block webRTC (missing about:config) *No tab groups *No print/pdf Why block about:config if devs dont have time to fix UI,4
753,I love it but the new full screen mode is annoying and its something that I never asked for And I cannot turn it off,3
754,Downdate removed paste  go: bookmarks menu is still not easily accessible and bookmarks wont open in an existing window so I still have to manually close the previous (and unwanted) window afterward Still have to close all windows before deleting history otherwise it isnt actually deleted User defined settings still removed there are virtually no user customization options Firefox still downgraded All I ever really wanted is for Firefox to open with my bookmarks page it sucks now :(,1
755,Ive been trying to add random user agent to my addon list but first is not on the pre selected list then after I searched it is not adding to the list Bring back ,1
756,Best browser My whole family uses firefox on all devices whether phone smart TV tab laptop PC fantastic interface Thank you firefox programmers,5
757,so far so good also is there a way you can add a feature thatll enable aspect ratio tweaking when streaming movies onlinethis way I can get rid of the black bars,4
758,Is good I liked it on pc back then and I like it on mobile now too Its pretty epic,4
759,Also not a fan of the new version: For example: why dont you show my favourites and collections (mediumrare feature anyway) when I edit the url of an existing tab like you did before (Sometimes I want to recycle the current tab to go to another site) Also: Please dont overlap my tabs with Tab closed  undo whyyy do you keep making everything worse,2
760,Used it for years now latest updates nearly changed that for good Removing only later adding useful features like a custom homescreen and even now adding annoyances like the tab screen(no ability to change their order) It isnt too annoying especially as the largest problems were already patched yet none of those existed in the versions we used for years So allow rollbacks or allow people to customize their browsers again,4
761,A lot of crashes and buggy behavior very frustrating user experience,1
762,The old Firefox wasnt great and this isnt either One step forward two steps backwards Despire that you still cant bookmark all tabs or search tabs Dont even think of installing your own addons or using other functionality Fennec had Edit: Why would you do this to your users Why release this obviously unfinished browser Edit 2: I have made several issues on GitHub and Ive seen how it goes Development is incredibly slow and hidden,1
763,Edited Nov92021 Upgraded to 3 stars (1) The users interface is still clumsy and unintuitive  take inspiration from Samsung browser they did a much better job (2) Home button (DONE) (3) Add an option in SETTINGS to permanently choose whether to OPEN NEW TABS in FOREGROUND or BACKGROUND instead of the popup switch notification (3) Allow Collections themselves and items within to be rearranged and sync them across devices and desktop browser (4) Assign shortcuts to longpressed buttons,3
764,A year ago I gave a poor review due to inefficient tab management Good to see that swipe to change tab is a nice addition and a step in the right direction But closing a single tab still needs THREE (3) clicks Just adding a shortcut button or specific swiping motion to Close current tab would go a long way Adding seperate tab bar as in desktop versions would be even better Still not keeping FF as default browser (Opera) but at least not uninstalling immediately either this time,3
765,Its the best open source browser out there if only more people downloaded we would have a safer digital environment,5
766,It is slow has the worst interface of all mobile web browsers it has just a couple of addons that do not really work viewing the desktop version almost never works In contrast to the desktop version this one is the worst mobile browser ever Closing all tabs and reopening the browser opens the last used tab,1
767,Its a great app in my experience The only thing that I would wish for is an offline page feature There should be an option to download a page as html to read it offline or much better if we can download it in reader mode In that way we can take full advantage of the reader modes interface and the offline page feature,4
768,Only one irritating thing Having to close tabs manually in order to not have in the background is really annoying to me I know there are options to close them Automatically but they are a day then two etc I want the option to close them instantly It irritates me that I cant I would have thought it would be an option,3
769,It not that bad It definitely lacks the reload page after you swipe while being on the top Not sure why you didnt add the rest of addons Only some work on the night version sure but it is still better than none Also the ability to customise like you can do on desktop would be much appreciated (userChromecss) For example I use productivity addons and without the ability to hide the options it is really easy to bypass them unfortunately :( Overall it has potential,3
770,Works as expected but you cant speed up videos without the audio glitching Worst part is they believe the issue is fixed as they said on their GitHub I would say use addblock browser unless you want to watch on background,3
771,firefox is the best browser it doesnt have a thousand other garbage programs that load with it like chrome doesnt slow your device to a slow grind because it does not have all the advertisement profile programs that watch your every move  like chrome I use firefox on every device I touch Mozilla is the answer thank you Mozilla and thank you Firefox,5
772,Cant handle redirections well Only the tab that is being redirected becomes unresponsive You can recreate this bug by trying to log into epic games store or using prime gamings bethesda account linking link Cannot recreate the same bugs in duckduckgo browser or chrome Edit: with the latest update crashes sometimes when trying to download files Had enough New problem every update will still use on pc Uninstalled,1
773,I think I might be dumping this app Im getting annoyed at unsolicited messages telling me to close a tab because it hasnt been used for a while These messages are supposed to be disabled I DONT WANT TO CLOSE THE TAB its open for a reason am I no longer allowed to make decisions for my self ,1
774,Firefox has and always will be great Were so thankful for your service to us all over the years Great browser adorable logo and looking out for security is going to get them bonus love from their long time supporters,5
775,Thought Id try Firefox again Very disappointed to find it wont store addresses on the Android version In 2022 when nobody cares about app size anymore the Firefox reason is to keep the size down so more people use it Please resolve this On a tablet mobile mode is annoying and I have to change to desktop mode for each page access Please give an option to set this permanently,1
776,9Years Chrome userhere is my opinion1ST reason why i move to firefox is because firefox support addonsespecially the adblocker which is much better than chrome which is pretty much none2ND Chrome just not like it used toit performs worse than before at least on my phone which do not happen with firefox3RD just want to try something new which i dont regret at allthere is one issue thatve been bothering me thoits the app keeps opening a new tab if i dont close an existing one,1
777,The only thing I like about this browser is it actually can support addons like uBlock and HTTPS Everywhere which is great considering many of android browsers dont have this kind of options But the thing is there lack of buttons and gesture when you browse like opera does In my opinion it seriously needs a second toolbar for other buttons,4
778,Yet more pointless changes but none addressing the fact its been dumbed down so much over the years Still no about:config History still garbage and unsearchable Really an absolutely rubbish product compared to what it once was No surprise Mozilla market share is now next to nothing Chromium is simply a far better product and thats without Google marketing The only saviourn for Firefox is the availability of ad block extensions Sort it out,1
779,New updated hides the Android navigation bar (back switch apps home) Very frustrating,1
780,Overall good quality ui  other features but i have problem on save download cant change location pls add location to SD Card > Downloads,4
781,I like this app but sometimes it is very slow to load compared to Google Also memory management is terrible I have to regularly delete the user data to get memory back Should be some better settings or ability to store data on the SD card,3
782,Browser is too lagy When I open some sites like Amazon filpkart etc whereas the chromium based browser work very fine so that please improve that otherwise it is good,3
783,why is there no forward back and refresh buttons Still worth it for the privacy,4
784,I use the app on my android device and there is a big problem On many sites the tool bar is blocking a part of the site Also another problem is that a lot of sites arent in full screen and are zoomed in For example on a certain site there is a web event to start it you need to press the start button in the bottom middle of the screen but the web site is zoomed in and i cant even see that part of the screen,2
785,Amazing speed compared to many browsers i have used till now The speed and overall ui/ux is mind blowingHighly recommended since it is much better than ChromeKeep it up guys,5
786,To saving some Websites in bookmarks we need to edit its link In bookmark it is possible but in top site is not possible Also for the links which seved in home screen it is not possible Firefox was very slow in the past but now it is very fast,3
787,Previous versions worked seamlessly Now experience in web surfing file upload and download printing webpages is like hell Totally disappointed Last time moving to older version 6890 helped me But there is no option to signin in older versions before 79th Ver,1
788,The best browser Im glad I made the switch Sometimes the tab synchronisation doesnt work tho Everything else is amazing Keep up the good work devs :),5
789,Ive been using Firefox for as long as its been in existence but I dont like the recent update on my mobile It just doesnt feel right and with the address bar at the bottom of the page is inconvenient Not going to stop using it though because I still think it is one of the more ethical browsers in the market,3
790,now cant even set website as home oage why is this not optional so many bugs URI wont show up until you scroll all the way back to top of many pages browser freezes and crashes often on some pages content is blanked out in black on some pages complete browser fail (app shutdown) happens perhaps once a week reading view causes Back to be triggered on some pages doesnt do anything except change icon color on others,1
791,The browser is fast And the addons are good But 2 major things need fixing asap 1 The scorlling smoothness feels off It needs to be more smooth to compete against chrome 2 In the year 2022 there are still apps that dont support splitscreen view Why an internet browser doesnt support multitasking by splitscreen is beyond me I have an 7+ inch screen and i cannot have firefox and another app in splitscreen BIG fail from devs,2
792,Tabs dont close as expected If I press back half a dozen times  enough to make the app close it shouldnt undo that when I open the app again Instead either close the tab instead of the app Or at very least dont undo the several back presses,2
793,utterly unusableRemoving tabs structure not an update but a downgradeIf one could give negative starsthats what this would deserve,1
794,Easily one of my favourite browsers to use because there is always cool new stuff being added,5
795,On computer Firefox works amazing but on mobile especially on Android UI is not as good as other rivals I use Firefox on mobile just to sync bookmarks and history I hope them to improve UI in future Also please bring tab groups to Firefox on mobile Google brave any other chromium browsers have tab groups which allow us to switch back and forth tabs very easily,3
796,New update has rendered addons like downloadhelper incompatible I can no longer hold my finger on a video stream and save to device it always opens up in a private window when i click a link from a text email which prevents auto logins to websites and sometimes prevents me from saving a new password when signing up to something new There is an old saying if it aint broken dont fix it you have just tried to do too much and lost sight of why we used mozilla in the first place Simplicity,1
797,Recent update on my galaxy tab 7 I am unable to open Firefox it keep hanging and closes by itself,1
798,This browser is simply too bad Its not what it used to be Its not quick settings of specific things are hard to find Horrible I know its free but idk i like the tracking protection and those things but the user experience is BAD,2
799,Great app I just have one issue I would want to be able to see if a site is http or https before clicking on it If thats added I would rate it 5 stars easily one of the best browsers out there (also I was trying to find the setting to turn on https only mode but I dont think it exists on the android version of the app),4
800,The best way to preserve a free internet is one that has to do with keeping competition among web browsers and maintaining alive good options that have very little if not any relationship with the big tech such as Microsoft Alphabet or Apple the usage of this browser is a little step towards living by this principle and the very app is for me a great way to keep a good degree of diversity a very noble endeavor by Mozilla and a crucial cornerstone of what is the internet navigation today,5
801,Having been en a old FF faithful for years I switched to Brave a few years afo because simply put it was a lot faster than FF That was about 4 years ago Now I have a new handset running Android v11 this new version is a lot faster and is very close to or is now just as fast as Brave (more testing to be done) However Im not a fan of how it silently and cheekily sets FF as your default browser Thats a huge no no in my book Time will tell if I return to my new old favourite of Brave,3
802,Syncs well with my desktop doesnt seem to take too much resources almost never crashes and supports every site Ive ever tried Only the function for quickly sending a link from desktop to my phone is a little buggy sometimes it takes a while for the link to appear Other than that its excellent,4
803,The fullscreen bug makes the app unusable Hope it will be fixed soon,1
804,Not quite as secure as on desktop but supports the most important addons and works like a charm,4
805,I like Firefox It syncs great on my phone and tablet My little complaint about this browser in my tablet is it doesnt has the interface that are tabletfriendly I have a suggestion that is to have an option that making the desktop site default to the browser Thanks :),4
806,On multiple sites if not all text selection doesnt work its jumpy and buggy I have the latest version of Firefox but this was a problem in the previous versions too I hope it gets fixed because its very annoying and the only reason I keep Chrome on my phone,2
807,New update removes the ability to access bookmarks and other menus after opening a new tab You must compmete a web search nothing but a waste of time and data to access your bookmarks Very poor UI/UX design to make a user conduct a unrequired websearch before they are even permitted to access bookmarks Off to chrome then,1
808,I find the use of extensions on mobile really useful I havent found any problem with the application,4
809,Really good browser Good performance Nice features and addons that make the browsing experience more smooth I do have some issues with downloads crashing One cool feature thatll be nice is a search bar for your history and bookmarks Think itll make things faster to look up,4
810,This may be a me problem However I have the duckduckgo plug in installed and was tired of it I wanted simple Google back on(duck duck go uses imaps which sucks) could not get rid of the add on Could not figure out how to change home page Im not computer illiterate(I think) it used to be more Intuitive go back to that,2
811,l have used Firefox for over 15 years now lt is easy to navigate stabil and improving with each new update l have tried the others but l always come back to Firefox Some may have a different opinion but Firefox simply put it works for me,5
812,This new release have ruined firefox  its too confusing now  options for saving the page as pdf  print save as pdf are no more No option to search bookmarks added  when i clicked one of the bookmark to go to that site the bookmark vanished from the bookmark folder  the history display is very confusing with the site name and google url appearing apart from each other plus this firefox version actually occupies aprox 245 MB space in my Android phone uninstalling this ,1
813,Ruined by the aggressive way that it refreshes the page when you switch to another app Makes it impossible to enter security codes etc which are delivered via mail or text as part of 2FA I have switched to Chrome The best part of the app is the browser controls at the bottom of the page,1
814,Its a great browser infact one of the best But a major feature is lacking It should show the download status of a file when its being downloaded (Like % completed download speed  total file size) Currently you can see it only when the download is complete,4
815,Still crashing over the weirdest but different things 1 day it was any links opened from my text next day it was because I am using YouTube through Firefox  thats a no go that day I wonder what is next I have used and loved Firefox for decades now but this update is absolute trash,1
816,When using bookmarks you start out in the root of the bookmarks every time not in the last folder you opened The behavior in Chrome is much better when you select bookmarks it opens the last bookmarks folder eg news and you can select a favorite there Try Chrome and you will see Please enable this it is the only reason I have been using Chrome on mobile the past years,1
817,it took few days to get use to the new UI but its perfect and respectful of my privacy,5
818,A big concern is how much of Firefox data Google and Meta/Facebook have access to Anyway to prevent my data from being accessed by search engines While accessing Gmail from for eg Edge browser Google prompts to switch to Chrome However when using Firefox as a browser Google isnt worried Wondering why Hence moved to DuckDuckGo browser which promptly blocks Google  Facebook Mozilla working closely with Google Data is a matter of great concern as users data is being harnessed,2
819,Having re introduced the option to save searches to users home screen which works perfectly well in saving items people want to reference Firefox has yet again cluttered the home page with random articles from search history or somewhere How does one remove all this unwanted clutter to revert to an empty screen that stays empty,1
820,Nice to use but sometimes the tabs will black out after leaving and returning to the app and refreshing doesnt restore them so I have to reopen a fresh one in another tab Pages also refresh very often (about almost every time you leave the app and come back to it or switch tabs) which is disruptive to browsing at times,3
821,Usually I rate this 5*s Though with the unswitchoffable auto zoom feature android version offers it rather sucks Trying some basic tinkercad design can be a real challenge Come on guys give me some options Id really hate to have to find another browser just for this Or is this a problem with Tinkercads website Love some feedback,3
822,Good but why is it full screen after last update Bring back the nav buttons please,3
823,Can use extensions unlike chrome and historically Mozilla vets them MUCH better FF has All the usual good ones ie noscript ublock origin https everywhere Chrome still has nothing Nothing FF is bit slower with addons but that is the extra processing needed chrome has nothing so is faster but less secure due to lack of any script  ads protection,3
824,Full screen video on Samsung a52s pushes video down so missing bottom of whatever is playing Very annoying,1
825,Mozilla please bring Firefox Lite back Its good to see that youve developed Firefox for Android to such a level But there are phones where storage becomes an issue and where users need is a simple web browser that simply works We loved Firefox lite a lot and now without any other option we are switching to a Opera Mini and Opera Touch which lightweight browsers But we still love Firefox and want to continue to use it as it syncs good with its desktop version and is clutter free,3
826,Firefox help sends you around in circles and is not kept up to date Cannot print from mobile app  and help files are not accurate as to what steps to take The steps must have changed but the instructions have not been updated,1
827,Best browser so far Just one issue though  Google search results looks a little different on firefox (android) than on other browsers The workaround is installing an addon but I would prefer if it was something that wouldnt need an addon,4
828,Opening recently visited links from the homepage doesnt work (yet) Thank you for being able again to open a favorite page from the address bar of an already used tab Please also add functionality again for opening links from mail in background closing a tab while search in page is active rearranging tabs choosing from search engines more quickly (small icons above the address bar as in the old Firefox),2
829,This app sucks ive been trying to login in some pages it does not want to it automatically log out,1
830,I prefer this browser on Android over any other Not only is this a really fast loading application for browsing but it is also leaving me with the impression that the ads function is minimised which gives me a better and uninterrupted experience while surfing unlike the garbage that Google has,3
831,Bugs once solved are popping again Enter a search keyword hit the checkmark and Firefox does  nothing Close the tab open a new one do the same  works Was solved once is here again I really cant stand what you did to my once favourite browser,1
832,It is easy to launch the built in web browser and call it a day but I took a step extra and gave the chance to the best application with fox in its logo and I dont regret it For me personally the only thing missing is swipe down to reload the page a small inconvenience that I can live without,4
833,Needs a lot of update to get it working the same as OLD versionalso keep on getting battery warning fire fox not closing down How to shut of fire fox when not usingexit doesnt do itupdate i cant copy and pastlatest march update NOW Firefox constantly crashing crash crash crash crash crashwelcome to crash foxcos thats all it doesmarch 20 updatetime for the bin Updatewhy cant you fix itASAP pleaseso many updates and YET firfox keeps crashing on eBay login,1
834,Its a great browser but it has one drawback When we download anything and exit the browser the download notification also goes away Please fix this issue that download and download notification doesnt stop on browser exit If this issue gets fixed then I will definitely give it 5 stars,4
835,Its a good browser in pc and in Android too most user friendly with private browsing features,4
836,Dear kindly add feature of save page as a pdf in next update it was very usefullthanks,5
837,I am so happy that I left Chrome behind Firefox is the best browser I have used in years,5
838,Needs to have option to swipe down to refresh/reload a page or allow use to change options in url toolbar I dont mind clicking manual refresh but its pretty annoying to have to keep opening drop down windows Going back to chrome for now,3
839,Best browser ever Saying this after 25 years in the industry building web server and web services applicatuins firefox ever since Netscape had a robust planning and devotion for great software startegy software architecture without compromising top notch features I could dive into endless details but in layman terms Firefox is THE starndard for a web browser Some companies throw truckloads of money to their dev teams but their dev efforts come with a compromise to push agendas,5
840,Generally a good browser but disabling browser notifications doesnt work,3
841,Few of the great browsers that give users the option to move the address bar to the bottom Browsing speed is decent and current addons are enough for the casual browsing Updated to OneUI Android 12 recently and Firefox doesnt follow the device theme anymore specifically if the device has the theme (dark mode) scheduled,3
842,If you added the option to swipe down the URL search bar to view opened tabs that would save 1 extra click,3
843,Imptove Areas Zoom multi windows Hisory Bookmatks give no password  history save Mode in settings,1
844,Few complaints Best part is getting to install an ad and tracking blocker like uBlock,4
845,There is only one suggestion I have Tabs within tabs Rather than having to open another tab and having to scroll through several tabs to find what youre looking for it would be nice to be able to group tabs together,3
846,Stable but online its still open protcols anomaly to phones app when mozilla arrives privatisation open to no result sad,2
847,The app UI revative to the how and what user primarily use Firefox for can be bettered much much more,3
848,I dont like the download feature of this I cant see the progress of my download when I dont using external download manager as I can in other browser,3
849,Questionable UI choices poor home page options pathetic bookmarks folder organization (why bookmarks toolbar folder when anyway it doesnt make sense on mobiles Why not flat structure) Could have been a much better browser My personal recommendations are Firefox on PC/Mac and Bromite/Samsung Internet on Android,2
850,Finally no ads and privacy centric Using with Duckduckgo search engine Supports addons,5
851,There is significant improvement compared to last time I tried Firefox on Android 2 years ago good job,4
852,There should be an option to keep the browser in DESKTOP mode on all the sites without requiring to turn it on manually for each sites and should disabled from the settings +1 more thing ie Please do optimize it for the tablets too,3
853,Still garbage Bookmark and status bar icons not visible in dark theme Home tab UX is just garbage still cant rearange top sites cant swipe on searchbar to switch tabs on it Home not showing in tab swicher opening fav site and going back to home leaves site in tab switcher Make UX like in the other browsers Utterly slow page loading and lags with Dark Reader addon enabled since theres no native dark theming for unsupported websites There isnt any new addons this year,1
854,Yknow what would be really funny If we just like had a menu for add ons with options the user can pick but like they do nothing anyway that would be so hilarious and funny What happened How How on earth did the best browser on the market just become one of the worst in a matter of months,1
855,Browser is fast but a little clunky I feel safer using it though,4
856,works better than any other browser and very good tracking protection,5
857,Missing a lot of features like: gestures for closing tabs switching between them opening new tab navigate forward/ backward reflow text when zooming search in history grouping domains in history customize buttons on address bar etc I appreciate the bottom bar option and that its pretty fast,3
858,Please bring back the tab queue Good that you can launch straight into Private Mode Bad that it doesnt open at the last used tab in that mode Very bad that 951 doesnt seem to be deleting cookies at exit Even worse that 962 is significantly slower,1
859,Perfect for those who want privacy with strong antitracking features,5
860,Very unhappy after latest (8 months) design Updates and changes I used to have a homepage to a traffic cam now it is to latest pages visited and when I finally find my traffcamera view in that junk of recent (that I dont care for anymore) the Firefox actually does not come refreshed,1
861,The new firefox is great but not without some bugs formsgle (google forms) links try opening through play store in google play service page when open links in app is enabled but works fine when it is disabled Please fix this And also bookmarks cannot be created using this app This breaks my flow between desktop and mobile Collections are fine but please focus in bookmarks too,3
862,One of the browsers I really want to switch to But I dont want to create yet another account just to sync bookmarks history and passwords between devices I would love to switch if you guys could implement sync method just like Brave Browser by scanning a QR code or by a passphrase,3
863,Your browser is awesome but its size very big please solve it without any security issues thanks ,4
864,Can we have a dual toolbar layout style For example the top is only contains address bar and the bottom contains navigation such as search tab overflow menu Like in Chrome Duet v79 Its really hard to tap the overflow menu by right thumb as its position is in the very corner,3
865,The GUI looks modern and sleek and a definite upgrade from the old one The tab switch is a bit weird but I do like it as its something different from anything Ive seen before More customisation which is always nice One complaint is that you cant choose any other addons apart from the recommend list which I do feel a bit disappointed about but overall a good browser for a normal user who cares about privacy,4
866,I tried again The settings ask if cookies are accepted and of course they arent Looking at web pages it seems that they are Obviously this is comparing it to the grown up PC version I dont need cookies but the advertising sector does,2
867,I was hopeful that you would make a complete experience This current UI has potential in my opinion But its already been one year since the last PROPER update Especially regarding addons I think well eventually have to move on to Chromium Sad to see this die,2
868,It used to be good but now Im finding more and more sites which are not compatible with it They either freeze (unable to refresh) or load infinitely Sometimes the UI is missing components Sites include Synology DSM Plex Microsoft and etc,1
869,Why does it redirect me to Facebook messenger when I am browsing the Facebook website Please fix it,1
870,One thing: when im typing the domain name and clicking the back button instead of going forward I see some artefacts flashing instead of pure keyboard closing animation In chrome I see another thing,1
871,So far it has been a positive lateral move from the Queen if the internet aka Google Chrome Small steps I to take it day by day,4
872,Did work but now only issues on ebay website doesnt hold cookies anymore,3
873,Probably the best browser for smartphones On of the best feature here  PC extensions support With this helpful feature I can use extensions which helps me block ads and protect me form malware and fishing Thanks for secure browsing,5
874,Hey 1 issue is when we select toolbar at the top when we search thru Google search in the webpadge we can type but i am not able to see what i am typing what i noticed is there is free space at the size of toolbar in bottom 2 if possible give option to search history in Mobile,3
875,Please give us an option to Hide that QR Code | Search Engine on homepage while typing Since I do not prefer that I need an option to Hide that,1
876,There is a lot of potential but always leaves something to be desired +addons (big plus) +privacy settings (such as hide recent searches) still slower than most competition autofill services do not always work and when they do the password is visible for a few seconds ugly UI,2
877,Unlike the windows version of firefox this one does nothing when there is NotificationrequestPermission() in the sites code Which is idiotic because in the settings there are only two options Always ask and block So the site developer cant ask and the app user cant manually allow,1
878,Best internet browser for mobile fast reliable secure and the most important thing its not google chrome,5
879,Good app but onscreen keyboard duplicating characters in search box plus cursor is acting erratically,3
880,Worst app You cant predict when it will work and crash matter how many times you access it It hogs memory to the fullest extent of available memory on the device,1
881,Works great but doesnt open the native app (eg Google maps) instead needing you to select menu options to push it to the app Perhaps thats a result of privacy options and an intended feature,4
882,There isnt a translator The graphics can be improved: a bit confusing with too many things and with old graphics Impossible to print a webpage The close tab action with grid tabs is not well done and slow Impossible to show bookmarks on the home screen,3
883,Please stop autohiding the phone navigation bar I want a back button visible at all times when Im browsing,1
884,Does not support ipv6 urls Urls with more than one subdomain do not go to http I dont know where they go to Is it a misconfiguration in the dns records,1
885,Best Browser with one of the best plugins Love using Mozilla Firefox,5
886,With the new (2020) Firefox: Awful Ive stopped using it except for very limited purposes,1
887,Hate the new look and features It is worse than the old browser All the work you did to try and update it only ruined it I encourage everyone to use something else Update its still buggy and the new features suck,1
888,Somehow they managed to f up predicting site during typing in address Sites Ive visited once years ago appear before sites i visit almost daily Gets so annoying to have to type pretty much whole address for it to realise what i want,2
889,Switched from Chrome on both Windows and Android in one fell swoop and havent looked back Firefox has come a long way from its humble beginnings and finally beats Chromiumbased browsers with ease Fast with a nice clean UI,5
890,A disaster doesnt even keep tabs open when changing between apps and sync is off everytime you close it,1
891,Lightweight and fast browser I like the features that help protect my privacy,5
892,Great Browser with good privacy and the only browser not using Googles Chromium,5
893,Firefox is my default browser on PC but not on my Android because:  No search options in bookmarks  I cant use old extensions in new versions  In recent tabs I cant lock or pin tabs cant duplicate tabs cant group tabs like Chrome Android browser  No Video Assistant player like Samsung Internet browser,3
894,You can no longer reorganize your tabs in the new version and many other similarly annoying features I mean lets be honest this project is strangling itself Its about as popular as edge and samsung internet which really speaks volumes,1
895,There is only one bug that is after searching something the keyboard still appears,3
896,I recently got a new phone and logged in to my firefox  all the collections that Ive built for years have been deleted I had no issues whatsoever with Firefox but since this I do not trust Firefox because it is so easy to lose data and saved pockets /collections etc,1
897,After I struggled to process some particular application online with all the browsers I had on my smartphone I tried Firefox out and the application went very well and smoothly I never looked back again I trust Firefox and highly recommend it to everyone,5
898,I love Firefox but the mobile app simply isnt as good as Chrome Its too laggy which is a shame considering all the otherwise cool features like addon support and sending tabs to Firefox on desktop,3
899,This browser seldom lets me down Typically very responsive with positive results,2
900,I have used Firefox in the past and its a very good and secure browser ,5
901,certain sites dont load images properly they just show me the filename and size giving me 404 errors when trying to open them but when coping those links and posting them on other programs they load just fine so its not the site,2
902,My 1st experience was good with Firefox it was awesome and Im sure Firefox always better than Chrome,5
903,Everything I as a user want But there are problems In comparison to other browsers Firefox has a lot less speed And browser comes with some unnecessary features (like pocket and etc) Other than those great browser,3
904,better than Google Chrome and does not crash all the time,5
905,After I downloaded an APK file from a website I tried opening it but failed many times Not like any other browser that allows me to install it Why,1
906,Keeps crashing I tried clearing data clearing cache uninstalling reinstalling and everything I could think of to resolve this issue Most of the time it works then it randomly starts this crashing cycle again,1
907,I was using lockwise too before and I could access my passwords quickly from lockwise icon in my launcher Since lockwise was not able to detect all the apps (and now firefox is) I had to copy my passwords from lockwise app it was an extra step but I still prefer my freedom But now while using firefox I have to make many extra steps to get my password I think a launcher shortcut may help users like me Still loving firefox and I appreciate you guys freedom motto over internet ,4
908,Very pleased with this web browser Excellent for my software engineering tool,5
909,A great browser with fantastic security features and you are supporting the little guy Yay,5
910,Great browser highly recommend Thanks for this browser very easy to use,5
911,With the new update it keeps redirecting me when I want to access some sites and I cant find the solution anywhere,4
912,unnecessary and annoying hate the bottom bar you made this once simple browser into a mess,1
913,This browser is going to die very soon🤦 Learn something for MS edge how much have they improved from IE,1
914,Getting worse with each update Now at times upper and lower phone bar is gone,1
915,Awfully resource hogging browser thats constantly draining the CPU forcing it to be flushed from memory by the OS and losing my session Also extremely buggy and not able to render banners and other web elements correctly On top of this it opts you in by default into running Mozillas studies on your phone (whatever that means) and sends them your usage data,1
916,No proper scroll bar unable to scroll down no proper ui Google search results and Google home page no news content only promoting pocket no proper night mode Ghatiya browser firefox will be shutdown soon Thats why I am using Opera browser and that is best,1
917,EDIT 2021: There is the Kiwi Browser It’s chromiumbased supports Chrome AddOns and even DevTools on Android – Old: This update ruined my experience My addons are not supported The devs decided to release the new incompatible Firefox as an update so Im forced to use the new version without my addons support Stay with your unfinished new version in beta PDFjs Custom Style Script Stylebot … GONE Fortunately there is the Firefoxbased Fennec FDroid v6811 where addons work,1
918,It has a nice and easy UI but it consumes a lot of battery compared to Chrome  Opera It takes even a handful of space Space is manageable but not battery Please look into it One more piece of advice: Download sections can be disintegrated into files|images|audios etc,3
919,My default browser since 2009 till now Never had a security issues or major crash It really help with my privacy concerns Unlike chrome it keeps my data safe and away from ads Hope it still forever this way,5
920,One of the best but still lacks old version features like Open with Firefoxcould open files from device storage like video photostxt etc file:///is no longer accessable and needs more add ons support eg: universal bypass,3
921,Still showing some ads even after blocking it from browser setting,3
922,This version is totally retarded everything is made to make user experience more pleasurable but the result is just the opposite: address bar at the bottom (who had that genius idea) address bar only appears when scrolling at the top FO,1
923,Recent updates have not been an improvement Have now almost exclusely switched to Chrome,3
924,All of a sudden you have to enable your camera in order to upload stuff from your phone Why is that a thing,1
925,This is the best browser ever but the new syncing method is awful It used to be soo easy and instant Now the process is long and sometimes the syncing fails,3
926,lots of bugs are there with the closing of tabs also with incognito mode,2
927,Generally good browsing experience If only there was an easy and obvious way to disable the prompt for dot up want to save this login Im using a password manager stop asking me,3
928,I love the bottom toolbar and helpful homepage This is the best mobile browser,5
929,Best browser around that genuinely cares about its consumers Ive been a Firefox user for many many years and not once ever had an issue I even disabled Chrome on my Google Pixel 6 and set Firefox as default,5
930,Just let us be able to access about:config again having to hit enable desktop every site/tab/link is tedious Ill come back if about:config is reinstated Until then I have to use a different browser so I can browse as desktop permanently,2
931,Overall its alright the only feature Im missing ability send links directly to my computer browser from other apps using share menu Now you need to open it in the mobile browser first and only then share to PC Not a big deal but downgrade compared to previous version,3
932,While generally functional I have problems with this browser all the time once I exit the app and reopen it the page I was on is often frozen or I am unable to search something new in the search bar without opening a new tab Sometimes the page is just blank and I have to close the app and reopen Such a pain,2
933,Why is there so few addons on Android I like Firefox on PC/Linux for privacy and protection but this cannot be achieved on my tablet,2
934,The mobile browsers improved a lot recently and I like having the option to move the URL/search bar to the top or bottom Theres still no option to set a custom homepage for new tabs Accessing Bookmarks is now far less complicated than it was although it still doesnt match the Samsung Browsers single tap access,3
935,Firefox (Nightly Version) is best A special thank you to all the Firefox employees,5
936,Its a simple concept have the feature delete cookies on exit just like on desktop with exceptions Sync those exceptions across devices Then it will be absolutely brilliant if you ask me,5
937,Been using FF since its beginnings Cant go wrong with FF,5
938,Try not to transition to rust again the new version still doesnt support all the features it did before Just a weird Chrome clone now,1
939,You tube is playing on background You can listen music with screen turned off,1
940,This browser has become so advanced it will be hard to catch up soon Thus far everything functions including password manager fast browsing and security features auto signing in features for Web pages are precise and quick dig it,5
941,Its my staple for browser on all devices I wish it had a barcode reader in the tools,5
942,Comparable to the desktop version Chrome is not a option for me(privacy issues) Tried Microsoft Edge that too is not good on mobile Firefox on the other hand 5/5 on both desktop and mobile,3
943,Normally I think Firefox is the best but since the most recent update it crashes very frequently when opening pages or opening popups This is happening on two different android devices from two different manufacturers both since getting the update,2
944,incredible came from chrome so took just a little getting used to but love it,5
945,Firefox is the main browser I gratefully and humbly consume hopefully aligning with the sacrifices involved in its procurement since I was a teenager ^^,5
946,Killed a once great browser Cannot even use adblock plus making it dangerous to surf with this browser,1
947,Last update version is very badbecause it dont work in full screen mode properly,1
948,Just trash my extensions not supported Where is about:config edited: it has improved greatly config still not here Dark mode and privacy features much welcomed Edit 18/12/2021: Not sure what is going on but I am getting frequent crashes every month This started with the 90+ versions Never use to take much notice before but now its becoming midlt infuriating,1
949,Hi Mozilla team Why does this app now opens a new tab whenever I tap on one my pinned sites How do I turn this off If I click on the address bar of a certain tab I want to stay in this very tab It is useless to have 10 times the same page open Please add an option to turn this off,1
950,Desktop mode is not working many a time kindly fix the bug,1
951,Limited extension support Some more functionality in the video player would be nice,3
952,Please make it optional that the tab goes to sleep when inactive it is VERY inconvenient when filling out a form and I need to change to different tab or app for some information and when I come back the tab reloads and I have to start over Rrally really NOT good and annoying,2
953,Love the browser but please fix the certificaten issues People are comllaining about for 2 years now You cannot have a self signed ca certificate (no they are not insecure as registered cas will tell you) and sytem wide User cas are ignored for some reason I would like to have internal websites and services on ssl bit firefox does not allow for this and all should be unsecured which I am sure firefox will Block Sohn aswel,3
954,Latest version fixes enforced Fullscreen bug Thank you for an excellent browser,5
955,Used to be the more functional and more cool browser to use on android The last major update had a serious detrimental effect though  the new tabs system is unintuitive and worst of all makes firefox slow to boooot,2
956,Solid browser for android It also allows Ublock Origin which none of the other do,4
957,Microlag in S22 plus when scrolling web pages while chrome scrolls smoothly,4
958,This Firefox is doing good especially whenever youre trying to look something up to surprise somebody with a gift,4
959,Better than all alternatives I could find Customizable and private,5
960,Thank you for this browser Against all odds it has survived decades and is still here as a solid full featured alternative to giant corp owned browsers who sadly inevitably end up trying to force their preferences (driven by financial interests) onto users,5
961,Its ok but why the need to make it so difficult to stop pop ups about:config does not work it just defaults to a Google search on the word config bizarre,2
962,Excellent browser with powerful synchronization functionality across many devices,5
963,I started using firefox in 2005 and it has been my preferred web browser ever since,5
964,The best browser Firefox from Mozilla I love it dark theme option is very good,5
965,After a shaky start to the new Android Firefox app the latest version of finally coming together We have back all the things that were originally missing and Im liking it,5
966,This is the best browser I have ever used Its fast and easy to use and does not use a lot of data,5
967,Was good month ago  then lost all my passwords Totally erased after update And as I have no laptop I guess theres no way to gave them back from android file Very much disappointed then :( AND AND AND still no addon for web site translation Seriously guys Shall considering using another Web browser soonish then,1
968,It was amazing but now cant print I have loved Firefox for many years now but moving over to Chrome as can actually print from that browser Toodle pip Firefox,3
969,Fast has great extensions available Highly recommended,5
970,New home page and interface are terrible Go back to the original,1
971,Frequent crashes hopefully will be fixed in time,2
972,I need the back button BACK The new update is so annoying,1
973,At all for me its better than Chrome Contains lots of nice features Some things has to be fixed and optimized but good anyway,4
974,I love this app before but after getting my new phone and installing this new update the add ons are now limited like theres a ton of them and you can even search which one you want but now theres only few left that you can choose and they all practically work the same PLEASE BRING BACK THE WEBTOEPUB ADDONS,2
975,Please add floating video youtube and wby fire fox didnt support java script other addons,1
976,suddenly i cant open the apps The apps immediatrly closed after i try to open itAlready try to re installing reboot device turn of and turn it on again and try to clear cache and residual but all useless I still cant open it So its 1 star until the developer team fixed it already send email with bug report but no response,1
977,Unusable since last update which hides navigation buttons and status bar,1
978,Too slow to use now everything lags with wifi or with data the browser is pretty much unusable now,1
979,Installed Firefox and was then bombarded with download messages re hmtl inframes Clicking x every few seconds became so annoying I uninstalled Firefox Not sure if this is due to Firefox or not,1
980,For every search I do a new tab opens Everythings perfect about the app but the devs dont bother to keep an option whether a new tab should be opened or not everytime a new search is madeI spend more time closing my tabs than actually having a hassle free surfing experience,3
981,the browser is amazing but it need new video player like Samsung browser or uc browser also download manager  and it need fast way to reload ((refresh)) pages,3
982,Good privacy protection and reliable ad blockers makes browsing the internet enjoyable,4
983,Superior to Chrome except only that it lacks a Translate in Page feature,4
984,Outstanding browser in some cases its ahead of chrome,4
985,Best browser interface but keeps crashing tabs and shows a dark unrendered page Refreshing does nothing Also wished it had pull down to refresh which I miss,3
986,Where has the back button gone There used to be a back button and now I dont know how to go back,1
987,The new layout is difficult to use compare to the old one Always jamed and take a lot of time to load every page How can I switch back to the old one Another jamed update (122021),2
988,In practice its almost impossible to remove specific items from browsing history because theres no searching in the history view And when something from the history shows up in address bar suggestions you cant delete it there either :/,3
989,It is as good as it is on a pc however it has sync delays Crashes when you change your account password and login to resync,3
990,Since the beginning of time firefox has been my preferred browser with all its ad ons,5
991,Chosen for Firefox and I am not stuck with it it is the best in everything,5
992,toolbar keeps hiding when browsing did not find setting to stop that very annoying,2
993,Very cool browser has its style Please add yandex search as a choice for a search engine (available on desktop forefox but not on mobile) and the ability to set a wallpaper on the homescreen and Ill be even happier,4
994,When am opening the app sometimes the screen is blank and no link works,2
995,Started to crash repeatedly over the last few days on my huawei phone,1
996,No always on Desktop mode and no automatic text reflow on zoom,2
